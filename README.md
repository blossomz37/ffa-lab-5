## 💡 Adapting This Platform to Your Needs

### 🔄 For Different Data Types

**Current**: Book sales data (title, author, price, ratings)  
**Your Data**: Customer records, inventory, sales, surveys, etc.

**Key Files to Modify:**

1. **Data Structure** (`src/lib/data-contract.ts`):
```typescript
// Replace BookData interface with your structure
export interface CustomerData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  purchaseAmount: number;
  region: string;
  // ... your fields
}
```

2. **ETL Pipeline** (`src/etl/transform.ts`):
```typescript
// Adapt validation rules for your data
const validateCustomer = (row: any): CustomerData => {
  return {
    id: row.customer_id,
    name: row.full_name,
    email: validateEmail(row.email),
    // ... your validation logic
  };
};
```

3. **Database Schema** (`src/db/schema.sql`):
```sql
-- Replace books table with your structure
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR,
  purchase_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  region VARCHAR
);
```

### 🎨 For Different Use Cases

**Examples of adaptations:**

| **Use Case** | **Key Changes** | **AI Prompt** |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Restaurant Analytics** | Menu items, sales, customer ratings | "Help me adapt this for restaurant sales data with menu items, daily sales, and customer feedback" |
| **Student Performance** | Grades, attendance, course completion | "Convert this to track student academic performance across multiple courses and semesters" |
| **Inventory Management** | Products, stock levels, suppliers | "Modify this system to manage product inventory with suppliers and stock tracking" |
| **Survey Analysis** | Responses, demographics, sentiment | "Adapt this platform to analyze survey responses with demographic breakdowns" |
