When a lifeline appears in the form of a very unconventional job in neighboring Cambric Creek, she has no choice but to grab at it with both hands.  Morning Glory Farm offers full-time hours, full benefits, and generous pay with no experience needed . . . there’s only one catch. The clientele is Grade A certified prime beef, with the manly, meaty endowments to match. Hands-on work with minotaurs isn’t something Violet ever considered as a career option, but she’s determined to turn the opportunity into a reversal of fortune.  When a stern, deep-voiced client begins to specially request her for his sessions at the farm, maintaining her professionalism and keeping him out of her dreams is easier said than done. Violet is resolved to make a dent in her student loans and afford name-brand orange juice, and a one-sided crush on an out-of-her-league minotaur is not a part of her plan—unless her feelings aren’t so one-sided after all.

My father is a LORD, a very respected member of a secret society that knows no bounds. When tragedy struck my family, we discovered we weren’t untouchable. Just when I thought life couldn’t get any worse, I was shown what hell is really like. Then he came and saved me. The devil disguised as my personal hero. But of course, nothing is for free. Not when a soul is up for grabs. I VOW. YOU VOW. WE VOW. Easton Bradley Sinnett—Sin—uses his power for his own sick pleasure. Like a typical Lord, he never thought about the consequences of his actions. I grew up with him, obsessed over him, craved him. He was who I pictured when I imagined doing things my body shouldn’t want. One day, I realized he was not who I thought he was. It didn’t change anything, though, because I was already too far gone. If anything, I fell for him harder. Every now and then, someone enters your life who flips it upside down. Sin wrecked me in the worst way, and I thanked him for it by serving on my knees. As they say, nothing lasts forever. Men like him never stay with a woman like me. I’m what they use, not keep. So when he threw me away, I shouldn’t have been all that surprised. My body had always craved the darker side of love. The kind that left bruises and scars. I was what most would call unholy. And when the devil whispered in my ear that he loved me, I was more than determined to show him just how devoted I could be.

A Lady’s job is to help him fit into a world unaware of his secret society. The Lord does not get to choose who he spends the rest of his life with. But there is always an exception to the rule. And I just so happen to be his. I VOW. YOU VOW. WE VOW. I was to wed a Lord of my parents’ choosing. Wealth can’t buy you everything, or I would have had freedom years ago. Instead, my strict parents made sure I lived a dull life in a mansion resembling a prison. But on my wedding day, I was handed over to another man—an even more ruthless Lord that my family hated.

Consequences be damned. Too bad I underestimated my husband and didn’t realize he was more determined to punish me than I was to succeed at escaping.

A little deer walks into the wolf’s den. I want answers. I know nothing of love, family, or stability, having been raised in the foster system and spat out at eighteen, pregnant, and with no memory of how that came to be. I try to find my estranged father, a man rumoured to be in the Mafia, hopeful he will use his influence to discover what really happened the night someone took my innocence. But I don’t find my father. I walk straight into the den of his associate, the Don of the Cosa Nostra. Clay Butcher. He is a cold, calculated killer. An emotional island in a perfectly tailored suit. He orders me to stay in his mansion and wait for my father to return. But living with Clay Butcher stirs feelings deep inside of me. Starved of attention all my life, I find his possessive gaze intoxicating. His rules ground me, his discipline holds me accountable, and his praise sets my skin ablaze. But he is a liar. What I don’t know is that he plots to use me. I am not just the daughter of his colleague, but a girl with a powerful heir in her belly. The heir to part of Clay Butcher's legacy. . .

Piper Bellinger is fashionable, influential, and her reputation as a wild child means the paparazzi are constantly on her heels. When too much champagne and an out-of-control rooftop party lands Piper in the slammer, her stepfather decides enough is enough. So he cuts her off, and sends Piper and her sister to learn some responsibility running their late father’s dive bar... in Washington.  Piper hasn’t even been in Westport for five minutes when she meets big, bearded sea captain Brendan, who thinks she won’t last a week outside of Beverly Hills. So what if Piper can’t do math, and the idea of sleeping in a shabby apartment with bunk beds gives her hives. How bad could it really be? She’s determined to show her stepfather—and the hot, grumpy local—that she’s more than a pretty face.  Except it’s a small town and everywhere she turns, she bumps into Brendan. The fun-loving socialite and the gruff fisherman are polar opposites, but there’s an undeniable attraction simmering between them. Piper doesn’t want any distractions, especially feelings for a man who sails off into the sunset for weeks at a time. Yet as she reconnects with her past and begins to feel at home in Westport, Piper starts to wonder if the cold, glamorous life she knew is what she truly wants. LA is calling her name, but Brendan—and this town full of memories—may have already caught her heart.

A Spade brother runs their prison for those who have wronged their society. It just so happens to be where the Lords have sent me. I VOW. YOU VOW. WE VOW. Most women within the Lords don’t get the chance to prove themselves worthy of the brand or the power that comes with it, but there’s always an exception. I’m one of them. Finally, my time had come to be assigned to a Lord. Not just any Lord but a Spade brother—Haidyn Jamison Reeves. I had everything under control until he found out what I was hiding. Everyone in our world knows the only way to get to the top is to sacrifice something the Lords want. So when Haidyn gave me a choice—become his toy or turn me over to the Lords—the decision was easy. I’ve worked too hard to get this far to allow a man to take what I’ve earned. I chose to become his dirty little secret over admitting I failed. It didn’t take long for him to unravel my web of lies, thread by thread, until nothing was left. He took over my life, blurring the lines until I discovered that what I thought I wanted was no longer what I needed. But even in our world, nothing lasts forever. Time had run out. The hourglass lay broken on the floor, shattering not only my future but everything I knew. I never thought that falling in love with a Spade brother would reveal so many secrets.

This book explores many dark topics. Please beware of the trigger warnings before reading. Your mental health matters. Fornication is a sin. As it reads, we should flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. They teach us that these thoughts, these actions, are immoral. But that dark side that lives inside all of us, the true nature of man, drives us to seek the need that burns within, demanding to be set free. Deep inside of our bones lies that intrinsic need, one desperate to escape. An innate behavior, seemingly out of our control. One that screams for sins they tell us are condemning. Aero is the throat from which I scream. The dark parts of myself I want hidden from this world are all he sees when he gazes at me beneath yet another mask.

I handle what needs to be taken care of, then I retreat back to my thousand acres of woods until I'm needed again.

Please check the trigger warnings at the beginning of the book before you start by following the link to my website. This story is dark, with horror, extremely explicit content, and unsettling situations/flashbacks. Readers are warned to read at their own risk. As the old saying goes, “Run away to the circus,” and it seems that is exactly what I have done. Except, this isn’t just any circus—it’s Oddity Carnival and Cirque, reputed to be the most horrifying spectacle in the States. It turns out, I wasn’t just running away from terror—I was unwittingly walking straight back into its chilling embrace. Attempting to adjust to my new life of madness, I find myself plunged into a waking nightmare: Hellion, the ringleader of The Hollow’s. With eyes like swirling vortexes and tattoos that seem to writhe and pulse across his skin, he ensnares me in his twisted web, his sinister obsession fixating on his broken dolly. Hellion seeks to shatter me, to break me down through pain and suffering for his own sick pleasure. But what he fails to realize is that pain is not foreign to me—it’s my home. As he delves deeper into his depraved games, he’ll come to understand that I am not so easily broken. I am a mosaic of splintered fragments and intricate puzzle pieces, a complex enigma that even Hellion, with all his distorted needs, may struggle to grasp or comprehend. Once a sadist’s cravings collide with a masochist’s submissive desires, the world around us dissolves into a mist of forbidden darkness and insatiable bliss, where boundaries blur and inhibitions fade into oblivion. As evil as this carnival may be, where illusions intertwine with shadows, the essence of who we are remains incomparable, defying the delirium that surrounds us. But, beneath our façade of face paints and behind our veils of secrecy, lie haunting truths that have the power to reshape the very fabric of our deranged reality.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ogtOR-kxL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWKNC55V,"[""Domination"",""Horror""]","[""[#2 in Erotic Horror (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/9807/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#3 in Erotic Horror (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/7620219011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#4 in Mystery Erotica](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/10159306011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)""]",his own sick pleasure sadist’s cravings most horrifying spectacle pitch-black horror his distorted needs masochist’s submissive desires unsettling situations/flashbacks,First,false,true,true

He's had enough heartache to last a lifetime, and he has no more need for love—earning him the reputation of a broody Scot and eventually turning his famous ancestral home into a den of iniquity. It doesn't take long for tales of his raunchy house parties to reach the rest of his family, though, inspiring them to hatch a plan to shake Killian out of his routine.  New Yorker Sylvie Devereaux is tough as nails—as the daughter of famous yet neglectful parents, she's grown a hard shell and keeps everyone at arm's length. So when she sneaks into Barclay Manor during a trip to Scotland to get a glimpse of a famous heirloom, she doesn't anticipate facing off against the brutish, maddening highlander who lives there. And she certainly didn't expect to ever see the bastard again.  Yet just weeks later, she's approached by Killian's family with a proposal—move to Scotland and marry Killian to improve his playboy reputation, and after one year, she'll walk away with ten million dollars. Sylvie agrees, even knowing that their plan is more deceptive than he realizes. But as she grows closer to Killian and the end of their year together, she has to decide: Is the love of a good man with a dark soul worth keeping, or is she willing to break Killian's heart now that it's well and truly hers?

Bullsh*%! My whole life has been about waiting. Playing it safe. Be the good girl, don’t color outside the lines. Put in the hard work trying to prove myself to Dad, then to my college professors, then to my boss at New World Media. Just waiting for the day when it will all pay off. And right when it was all starting to—I finally had the house, the job, I was even thinking about getting a cat—boom!—my life explodes and suddenly now I’m here and— “All done,” the doctor interrupts my thoughts, pulling off her gloves with a loud snap. Even from the bed where I’m lying, my legs spread like the Thanksgiving turkey, I can hear the impatient growl of the man standing in the doorway. If you can even call him a man. More like a beast out of a friggin’ fairytale. “Well?” Her pronouncement echoes throughout the room while the speculum is still inside me. “She’s a virgin.” Intended for mature audience. Steamy romance with dark themes. INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR: Q – Where did you get the idea for this book? A – Who doesn’t love a Beauty and the Beast story? I’ve been in love with this fairytale since I was a kid and read all sorts of different variations on it. Now that I’m grown up, well, I couldn’t help but imagining some darker twists and turns the story could take. A tortured hero, kidnap, and a girl falling for her captor—hello, this is the stuff dark romance is made of! Q – Why should I read this book? A – I write the kind of books I love to read, which is dark romantic erotica. I want stories that steam things up in the bedroom but not if those scenes don’t go hand in hand with three-dimensional characters, can’t-stop-flipping-the-pages suspense, and quality writing. I like alpha males, (doesn’t hurt if they happen to be billionaires)!, bad boys, BDSM, contemporary, urban settings, and fiction where women can be strong while also exploring all sides of their sexuality. My favorite books are ones that dare to go into the darkest and most taboo places in the human psychological experience, leaving you wrung out on the other end.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51R4LVgSmLL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0743GGRVF,"[""Billionaire"",""Bad boy"",""Teacher"",""Alpha Male"",""Contemporary"",""Doctor"",""College"",""Fairy Tale"",""Dark Romance"",""BDSM"",""Holiday"",""Steamy"",""Suspense"",""Animals""]","[""[#2 in Erotic Westerns (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/7620231011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#7 in Mystery Erotica](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/10159306011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#9 in BDSM Erotica (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/7620212011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)""]",three-dimensional characters darkest and most taboo places human psychological experience friggin’ fairytale,First,true,true,true

Except an unexpected discovery causes a wrinkle in his hope of getting her back. While Dylan and Erin have a past, Ford Harris, the local contractor they hired, currently has a “present” with her. After Erin became a widow, the two began seeing each other casually and kept it a secret for years. Unbeknownst to Dylan, Dayne hires Ford on as a permanent resort employee. Uncovering their relationship also leads to another discovery: Erin changed a lot over the years. All thanks to Ford. Now Dylan has a dilemma. Without Ford, he can’t have Erin.
