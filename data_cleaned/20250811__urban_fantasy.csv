Unfortunately, a magical force in the city is hitting back. On their first night in town, they discover somebody has unleashed skeletons on the city…and there’s an army of them. The good news is that as far as foes go, they’re not very impressive. Poet Parker’s team can take them out with relative ease. The bad news is they’re not stopping…and they’re getting bolder each and every night. San Francisco’s history leads to a lot of questions. Are the skeletons coming from the cemeteries that were closed? Seems only a fraction of the bodies were moved when the city shut down for burials more than a century before. Who is raising them, though? Between Golden Gate Park, Fisherman’s Wharf, and Alcatraz, Mystic Caravan has a lot of dark corners to search through. A nosy police officer—one who has his own paranormal task force at the ready—is another concern. Not all evil is created equal. Sometimes what looks like evil isn’t evil at all.

To beat him and take his throne, Aurora and Callum must form a dangerous alliance with one of the most feared Wolves in the Kingdom, Blake.

Harrow #1 New York Times bestselling author Holly Black makes her stunning adult debut with Book of Night, a modern dark fantasy of betrayals, secret societies, and a dissolute thief of shadows, in the vein of Neil Gaiman and Erin Morgenstern. Charlie Hall has never found a lock she couldn’t pick, a book she couldn’t steal, or a bad decision she wouldn’t make. She's spent half her life working for gloamists, magicians who manipulate shadows to peer into locked rooms, strangle people in their beds, or worse. Gloamists guard their secrets greedily, creating an underground economy of grimoires. And to rob their fellow magicians, they need Charlie Hall. Now, she’s trying to distance herself from past mistakes, but getting out isn’t easy. Bartending at a dive, she’s still entirely too close to the corrupt underbelly of the Berkshires. Not to mention that her sister Posey is desperate for magic, and that Charlie's shadowless, and possibly soulless, boyfriend has been hiding things from her. When a terrible figure from her past returns, Charlie descends into a maelstrom of murder and lies. Determined to survive, she’s up against a cast of doppelgangers, mercurial billionaires, gloamists, and the people she loves best in the world—all trying to steal a secret that will give them vast and terrible power.

We hope you survive. Loren Calla has only ever been ordinary. As a human struggling to survive in a city that caters to the needs of vampires, werewolves, witches, and other supernatural creatures, she always assumed her life would remain simple, predictable, and as safe as her world would allow. Until she barely escapes abduction at the hands of Darkslayers—supernatural bounty hunters that possess the Sight, a magical tracking ability that allows them to see a person’s aura—and one of her friends is taken in her place. The abductors are demanding a ransom: Loren's life in exchange for her friend's safe return. Loren will do whatever it takes to get her friend back—even if it means accepting help from Darien Cassel, the leader of the Seven Devils, the most feared Darkslaying circle in the city. Darien specializes in tracking down demons and criminals that are better off dead than alive, so when he takes a job to track down Loren and finds out she is human—and couldn't hurt a fly if her life depended on it—he decides to protect her instead of turn her in for a reward. As much as Loren doesn't want to admit it, Darien is her best and only chance at finding her friend alive, if she can somehow manage to get along with him—and not fall head-over-heels in love with him in the process, which is far easier said than done. When more women start disappearing, and some of them slowly turn up dead, Loren and Darien's search for answers takes them deep into Angelthene's corrupt underbelly, where they discover a dark secret that threatens to unravel their world.

Sera Swan used to be one of the most powerful witches in Britain. Then she resurrected her great-aunt Jasmine from the (very recently) dead, lost most of her magic, befriended a semi-villainous talking fox, and was exiled from her Guild. Now she (slightly reluctantly and just a bit grumpily) helps Jasmine run an enchanted inn in Lancashire, where she deals with her quirky guests' shenanigans, tries to keep said talking fox in check, and longs for the future that seems lost to her. But then she finds out about an old spell that could hold the key to restoring her power… Enter Luke Larsen, handsome and icy magical historian, who arrives on a dark winter evening and just might know how to unlock the spell’s secrets. Luke has absolutely no interest in getting involved in the madcap goings-on of the inn and is definitely not about to let a certain bewitching innkeeper past his walls, so no one is more surprised than he is when he agrees to help Sera with her spell. Worse, he might actually be thawing. Running an inn, reclaiming lost magic, and staying one step ahead of the watchful Guild is a lot for anyone, but Sera Swan is about to discover that she doesn’t have to do it alone...and that the weird, wonderful family she’s made might be the best magic of all.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ASJku2fLL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9ZDCGGN,"[""Witch"",""Second Chance"",""Magic"",""Supernatural""]","[""[#1 in Witch Romances](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/18882747011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#8 in Paranormal Witches & Wizards Romance](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/6401743011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#8 in Contemporary Fantasy (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/158579011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)""]","semi-villainous talking fox national bestselling author her great-aunt Jasmine dark winter evening handsome and icy magical historian Very Secret Society her quirky guests' shenanigans spell’s secrets weird, wonderful family INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER most powerful witches whimsical and heartwarming novel",Third,true,true,true

As one of the few witches in Britain, Mika Moon knows she has to hide her magic, keep her head down, and stay away from other witches so their powers don’t mingle and draw attention. And as an orphan who lost her parents at a young age and was raised by strangers, she’s used to being alone and she follows the rules...with one exception: an online account, where she posts videos ""pretending"" to be a witch. She thinks no one will take it seriously. But someone does. An unexpected message arrives, begging her to travel to the remote and mysterious Nowhere House to teach three young witches how to control their magic. It breaks all of the rules, but Mika goes anyway, and is immediately tangled up in the lives and secrets of not only her three charges, but also an absent archaeologist, a retired actor, two long-suffering caretakers, and…Jamie.

Neither of them were looking for love, but sparks fly and their fates collide on the popular wolf shifter dating show, Mating Season.  Aspen: I’m the lowest-ranking wolf from a pack that only exists to guard the shifter prison in our territory, but I’ve been planning my escape for years. I just have to make it through one more heat, then I’m done with this pack and the alpha-holes that run it. Everything changes when my pack gets an invitation to Mating Season, the reality show where Alphas and Lunas from around the country meet to pick their chosen mates. And my Alpha is sending me. I’m forced into a dangerous world where TV producers dictate the rules. As if that wasn’t crazy enough, a powerful and sinfully handsome Alpha has his sights on me, making me a target for the elite shifters from other packs. I never wanted to pick a chosen mate or settle down as some Alpha’s bride. I wanted freedom. But now I have to act the part viewers expect if I have any hope of surviving this year’s Mating Season. Ranger: The unmated Alphas may be on this show to find a match, but I came here for one reason… And it wasn’t her. When she walked into the wolf den wearing an oversized fluffy sweater and blinking those big brown eyes, my beast immediately staked his claim. I’m here to play the Alpha Games, but I intend to win so much more. I know what she is to me. She knows it too even if she denies the pull. Aspen is mine. Luna Trials, book one of Mating Season, is a dual POV wolf shifter romance story set in a future world where fated mates have become a thing of the past as humans and shifters integrate into a blended society.

What would it take for you to sacrifice your soul? As it turns out, watching my family be brutally murdered was all it took for me. Was it worth it? I’ll let you decide… Fast-forward five centuries, and I’m now the last vampire on Earth, with a robust collection of refined snark, pop culture references, and enough run-on sentences to make an English teacher return my test, face down. Things are going good, but there’s just one teeny tiny problem: I’ve met an angel and personally slayed demons, so I know there’s an afterlife. That being said, I’ve, ahem, control-alt-deleted my fair share of mortals since the 1400s. But I have a good excuse! I was hungies! Regardless, I’m pretty sure that’s frowned upon by the man upstairs. But what to do with a sin-drenched soul that is basically pre-marinated for Hell’s barbecue? Enter Father Thomes—a modern-day Houston priest with the patience of a saint and the tolerance of a man who’s fought the good fight his entire life. He’s my mentor, my spiritual GPS, and, let’s be honest, the only reason I might have a shot at seeing my family again in the hereafter. Papa T is like Alfred to my Batman, helping guide my preternatural abilities with his sage words and eternal patience. But while Batman avoids killing bad guys, I’m out here personally curating a VIP list for the afterlife—cultists, demons, politicians… you know, the usual suspects. Just when I start getting the hang of this whole ""murder-for-redemption"" gig, the universe decides to throw me a curveball: the apocalypse. Heaven and Hell are gearing up for the ultimate showdown, and somehow, I’m on the guest list. So, do I embrace my fate, fight the forces of doom, and maybe, just maybe, save my soul in the process? Or do I fake my own death, change my name to Todd, and open a blood smoothie bar in the Bahamas? Decisions, decisions. Love snarky vampires, epic battles, and a side of apocalypse?

Starting over in Ravens Hollow was meant to be simple - a chance to adjust to my new, nocturnal existence. No men. No complications. Just a bit of light investigative journalism in a quaint magical town by the sea.  Then Pongo the pup trotted into my life, and normalcy bled away faster than my resistance to a fresh pint of blood. I’d barely set up my desk at the Ravens Hollow Oracle before a renowned sculptor turned up dead at the town’s annual art exhibition.  What better way to get to know a place than by investigating its most suspicious residents? The only snag was Chief Whip - the infuriatingly handsome local lawman who’d rather I kept my fangs and my nose out of his murder investigation.  Too bad.

I walked away from my magic, my past, and the home I was born to protect. For the last decade, I’ve been scraping by as a PI in the non-magical world, solving human problems and ignoring the legacy that should have been mine. My magic is barely worth mentioning—unless you count my menial ability to sense emotions, which is about as useful as a chocolate teapot.  But then my oldest friend breaks into my flat with a desperate plea and I’m suddenly heading back to Witchlight Cove—a hidden magical town on the British coast I swore I’d never see again.  The Eternal Flame, an enigmatic magic that protects the town, has vanished. A ruthless property developer is circling my family home like a vulture. And a poisoning at the village fête proves there’s something far worse lurking in the shadows. If I don’t figure out what’s going on, I’ll lose everything—not just my inheritance, but the only people I’ve ever called family.  With my fiercely loyal retriever by my side, a murder to solve, and a smug, insufferably attractive rival getting under my skin, Witchlight Cove is about to test me in ways I never imagined.  Some legacies can’t be escaped. Some flames refuse to die. Perfect for fans of strong heroines, lovable animal sidekicks, and heart-racing urban fantasy, Secrets of the Forgotten Heir delivers action, charm, and supernatural surprises. With stand-alone mysteries, sharp humour, and a swoon-worthy slow-burn romance spanning the series, it’s an unmissable treat.

Born at the end of the old world, Miriam grows up during The Great Reckoning, a sprawling, decades-long war that nearly decimates humanity and strips her of friends and family. Devastated by grief and loneliness, she emotionally exiles herself, avoiding relationships or allegiances, and throws herself into her work—disengagement that serves her when the war finally ends, and The New Society arises.  To ensure a lasting peace, The New Society forbids anything that may cause tribal loyalties, including traditional families. Suddenly, everyone must live as Miriam has chosen to—disconnected and unattached. A researcher at heart, Miriam becomes involved in implementing this detachment process. She does not know it is the beginning of a darkly sinister program that will transform this new world and the lives of everyone in it. Eventually, the harmful effects of her research become too much for Miriam, and she devises a secret plan to destroy the system from within, endangering her own life.  But is her “confession” honest—or is it a fabrication riddled with lies meant to conceal the truth?  A jarring and uncanny tale of loss, trauma, and the power of human connection and deception, You Feel It Just Below the Ribs is a portrait of a disturbing alternate world eerily within reach, and an examination of the difficult choices we must make to survive in it.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41mlb-b4VXL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WLWJCCR,,"[""[#6 in LGBTQ+ Fantasy Fiction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/17861279011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#11 in Gay & Lesbian (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/6505519011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#14 in LGBTQ+ Fantasy (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/202437565011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)""]","disturbing alternate world one woman’s unusual life alternate twentieth century sprawling, decades-long war darkly sinister program",Third,false,false,true

Schwab's New York Times bestseller Vicious is a masterful tale of ambition, jealousy, desire, and superpowers. Victor and Eli started out as college roommates—brilliant, arrogant, lonely boys who recognized the same sharpness and ambition in each other. In their senior year, a shared research interest in adrenaline, near-death experiences, and seemingly supernatural events reveals an intriguing possibility: that under the right conditions, someone could develop extraordinary abilities. But when their thesis moves from the academic to the experimental, things go horribly wrong. Ten years later, Victor breaks out of prison, determined to catch up to his old friend (now foe), aided by a young girl whose reserved nature obscures a stunning ability. Meanwhile, Eli is on a mission to eradicate every other super-powered person that he can find—aside from his sidekick, an enigmatic woman with an unbreakable will. Armed with terrible power on both sides, driven by the memory of betrayal and loss, the archnemeses have set a course for revenge—but who will be left alive at the end? In Vicious, V. E. Schwab brings to life a gritty comic-book-style world in vivid prose: a world where gaining superpowers doesn't automatically lead to heroism, and a time when allegiances are called into question.

I came to Werewolf Territory to rescue my brother… And now he’s gone. With a war for the crown on the horizon and the monstrous Hunters just days away, I’ve got to say goodbye to the only family I had left, and it’s killing me. Worse, I can’t help blaming Dominic for not keeping him safe—even if it is irrational. My heart is shattered—I feel like I’ve lost them both. Still, we’ve got to work together if we hope to defeat Edmund and put Will on the throne--no matter how hard it is to be near Dominic, and not touch him. Even as I wage war with my own heart and we prepare for battle against Edmund the Vile, a greater threat looms over the Territories. A being so terrible…so strong, that it makes our current king look like nothing more than a chump with a chip on his shoulder. I can’t help but wonder if our unlikely mix of werewolves, vampires, and humans can defeat Edmund…and, even if we do, do we have any chance of surviving the hell-storm of what’s coming next?

Garrett is the alpha of the strongest wolfpack in the Midwest. Their worlds are about to collide in a way neither of them saw coming.  Emersyn’s heart was shattered when her father died when she was just twelve years old. If that weren’t enough, her mother married a man less than twelve months later, bringing her cruel step-brother into her life.  On her eighteenth birthday, she finally finds the courage to run away. She leaves behind the only life she’s ever known with just the clothes on her back and three hundred dollars in her pocket. She begins her new life under her new name—Emma.  For the first time in six years, Emma is finally free. She starts her new job, and her life begins to finally start tracking in the right direction. That is until the day she meets Garrett, the most gorgeous, intimidating man she's ever met. Unnerved by their connection, she tries to keep her distance. Little does she know that Garrett is the Alpha of the Northwoods Pack. She’s his mate, and he has no intention of letting Emma out of his sight.  Garrett isn’t the only wolf who has his eye on Emma, though. Things are about to get heated, and Emma is at the center of it all. When danger hits too close to home, Garrett pulls Emma into his world. She’s going to find out she has a lot more to do with his world than either of them realized. She's the Finder, and it's her job to find other humans with special abilities, like herself, who have been gifted by the wolf creator to help the wolf race. Change is coming to the Northwoods Pack and leading the change is Emma. She just has to survive first.  **If you like paranormal romance with fated mates, protective males, and strong females, this series is for you.

Wicked relishes the inspired inventions of L. Frank Baum’s 1900 novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, while playing sleight of hand with our collective memories of the 1939 MGM film starring Margaret Hamilton (and Judy Garland). In this fast-paced, fantastically real, and supremely entertaining novel, Maguire has populated the largely unknown world of Oz with the power of his own imagination.  Years before Dorothy and her dog crash-land, another little girl makes her presence known in Oz. This girl, Elphaba, is born with emerald-green skin—no easy burden in a land as mean and poor as Oz, where superstition and magic are not strong enough to explain or overcome the natural disasters of flood and famine. Still, Elphaba is smart, and by the time she enters Shiz University, she becomes a member of a charmed circle of Oz’s most promising young citizens.  But Elphaba’s Oz is no utopia. The Wizard’s secret police are everywhere. Animals—those creatures with voices, souls, and minds—are threatened with exile. Young Elphaba, green and wild and misunderstood, is determined to protect the Animals—even if it means combating the mysterious Wizard, even if it means risking her single chance at romance. Ever wiser in guilt and sorrow, she can find herself grateful when the world declares her a witch. And she can even make herself glad for that young girl from Kansas.  Recognized as an iconoclastic tour de force on its initial publication, the novel has inspired the blockbuster musical of the same name—one of the longest-running plays in Broadway history. Popular, indeed. But while the novel’s distant cousins hail from the traditions of magical realism, mythopoeic fantasy, and sprawling nineteenth-century sagas of moral urgency, Maguire’s Wicked is as unique as its green-skinned witch.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51I9-44LYiL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC14JY,"[""Witch"",""College"",""Mystery"",""Police"",""Supernatural"",""Magic"",""Animals""]","[""[#15 in Contemporary Fantasy (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/16195/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#21 in Contemporary Fantasy (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/158579011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#45 in Fairy Tale Fantasy (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/169457011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)""]",L.

She built a business, a home, and a future for herself and her son —a life without the pack that turned its back on her. She thought she was free. Until Valen returned. Now, he wants what he once rejected. A second chance. A future with their son. But Everly is no longer the girl he abandoned. She is strong. Powerful. A force all her own.

He’s the headmaster of a strange orphanage on a distant and peculiar island, and he hopes to soon be the adoptive father to the six dangerous and magical children who live there. Arthur works hard and loves with his whole heart so none of the children ever feel the neglect and pain that he once felt as an orphan on that very same island so long ago. He is not alone: joining him is the love of his life, Linus Baker, a former caseworker in the Department In Charge of Magical Youth. And there's the island's sprite, Zoe Chapelwhite, and her girlfriend, Mayor Helen Webb. Together, they will do anything to protect the children. But when Arthur is summoned to make a public statement about his dark past, he finds himself at the helm of a fight for the future that his family, and all magical people, deserve.

Thankfully, the fae king has offered up some of his most trusted men in an attempt to find me someone to marry. Unthankfully, he's sort of… possessive. Which means I'm sleeping in his room. In his bed. With him. While I'm trying to choose a mate from among a handful of candidates who barely seem interested in me. There's enough chemistry between us to light a fire, but he's not an option. I despise him, and he needs to focus on putting an end to the eclipses that keep making his people beastly and insane. We have to keep our hands to ourselves and deal with our own problems, to protect his kingdom. But when the next eclipse sets in, everything goes to crap. Because wild, out of control fae kings?

Until now. My whole life I’ve been nothing but a means to an end; livestock kept caged for the production of blood. I’ve stared through fences at the promise of freedom countless times, but the only way anyone escapes this hell is in the hands of a bloodsucker. The annual testing is about to begin, and those who pass are never seen again. So fu*k that. My twin and I decided to risk it all. To run before the royals could claim us. Turns out, that dream expired fast. Because when an original vampire decides to own you, there’s nowhere in this ruined world left to escape to. I’m at his mercy now, trapped in his castle, destined to become his creature, and forced into a dangerous game of rivalry between the seductive vampire princes. His beauty is a weapon I wasn’t prepared for, his cruelty a bane that strikes fear in the hearts of all, and his company a sin I’m going to spend my life repenting. I need to get back to my sister, but she’s caught in a trap of her own, tangled up with the last slayer to walk this earth and following his path towards vengeance. She’s at his mercy too, the man with violence tattooed across his skin, death trailing his footsteps as he stalks his prey - who just so happen to be the royal vampires who hold me captive. The gods are toying with us all, placing my twin and I on opposite sides of an ancient war. And in the end, I fear there won’t be any victors left standing. So I’m going to play a game of my own, let my captor use me as his puppet until I find my moment to strike. Let this hell-born ritual of lust, lies and blood begin. **This is a dark, fantasy romance series by the authors of Zodiac Academy with all the enemies to lovers vibes – don’t go expecting a sweet vampire with sparkling skin and a tendency to watch you sleeping. These vampires are savage and bloodthirsty, and the slayer who hunts them will stab first and ask questions later. This war-torn fantasy world is a brutal bi*ch and only those 18+ have a chance at surviving the darkness lurking between these pages. There’s no well-meaning vampires snacking on Bambies instead of babies, and if they get their teeth into you, you’ll be damn lucky to escape with your life and panties intact. So grab hold of your slayer blade (wooden stakes have too many splinters) and get ready to defy the gods, because this is going to be one helluva ride***",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51XhwSwngwL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFMDYFNK,"[""Supernatural"",""School/Academy"",""Enemies to Lovers"",""Aristocracy"",""Pregnancy"",""Vampire"",""Animals""]","[""[#46 in Paranormal Fantasy (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/12569916011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#85 in Paranormal Fantasy Books](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/9673710011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#219 in Romantic Fantasy (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/13922577011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)""]","dark, fantasy romance series war-torn fantasy world well-meaning vampires seductive vampire princes",First,true,true,true

And it was up to me to prepare my pack for the fight of our lives. But I don’t know which war will be harder to win–the one on the battlefield or the one in my heart.
