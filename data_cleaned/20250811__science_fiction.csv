In this New?York?Times bestseller and Today show Read with Jenna Book Club Pick, one lapse in judgment lands a young mother in a dystopian government reform program where custody of her child hangs in the balance, in this “surreal” (People), “remarkable” (Vogue), and “infuriatingly timely” (The New York Times Book Review) debut literary fiction novel. Frida Liu, a hardworking Chinese American mother, is pushed to the edge. She doesn’t live up to the expectations set by her immigrant parents or her wellness-obsessed husband. Only with Harriet—cherubic and beloved—does she find a measure of fulfillment…until she has a very bad day. In this close-to-future dystopia, the state targets mothers like Frida: mothers who check their phones, let their children walk home alone, or make one parenting error. Because of one mistake, Frida is sent to a government-run institution—a Big Brother–style reform school for “good mothers,” where every move is monitored, and even her love is judged. For custody to be returned, she must prove that a flawed mother can be redeemed and learn to be “good.” Filled with dark wit and emotional urgency, The School for Good Mothers is an intense, captivating novel that scrutinizes upper-middle-class parenting, systemic surveillance of women, and the violence exacted by both the state and one another. It offers a transgressive exploration of motherhood, resilience, guilt, and the force of love. Using spare, compelling prose, Jessamine Chan crafts an unforgettable, modern classic that resonates with readers of The Handmaid’s Tale and 1984, while centering a richly drawn woman navigating class, race, and motherhood under the gaze of an unyielding system.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41in6Nwm5+L._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093JHS53T,"[""Dystopian"",""Crafts"",""School/Academy""]","[""[#1 in Dystopian Fiction (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/3559311011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#1 in Women's Literary Fiction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/7588891011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#1 in Dystopian Science Fiction (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/6361470011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)""]","Barack Obama’s Favorite Books th e Carnegie Medal Handmaid’s Tale hardworking Chinese American mother dystopian government reform program New York Times Book Review upper-middle-class parenting Jenna Book Club Pick unforgettable, modern classic close-to-future dystopia her wellness-obsessed husband government-run institution spare, compelling prose very bad day intense, captivating novel Fiction First Novel Prize Big Brother–style reform school richly drawn woman navigating class PEN/Hemingway Award",Third,false,false,true

John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife's grave. Then he joined the army. The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce-and aliens willing to fight for them are common. The universe, it turns out, is a hostile place. So: we fight. To defend Earth (a target for our new enemies, should we let them get close enough) and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has gone on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding. Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force, which shields the home planet from too much knowledge of the situation. What's known to everybody is that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve your time at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets. John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine-and what he will become is far stranger.

On virtually every level, this is a sequel that hates sequels—a perfect fit for a hero who already defies the tropes. [Grade:] A”— Entertainment Weekly As a Red, Darrow grew up working the mines deep beneath the surface of Mars, enduring backbreaking labor while dreaming of the better future he was building for his descendants. But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. Darrow’s kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the Golds—and their only path to liberation is revolution. And so Darrow sacrifices himself in the name of the greater good for which Eo, his true love and inspiration, laid down her own life. He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within. A lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even love—but also the wrath of powerful rivals. To wage and win the war that will change humankind’s destiny, Darrow must confront the treachery arrayed against him, overcome his all-too-human desire for retribution—and strive not for violent revolt but a hopeful rebirth.

Golden Son changed the game and took the story of Darrow to the next level. Now comes the exhilarating next chapter in the Red Rising Saga: Morning Star. ITW THRILLER AWARD FINALIST • “[Brown’s] achievement is in creating an uncomfortably familiar world of flaw, fear, and promise.”— Entertainment Weekly Darrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society’s mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within. Finally, the time has come. But devotion to honor and hunger for vengeance run deep on both sides. Darrow and his comrades-in-arms face powerful enemies without scruple or mercy. Among them are some Darrow once considered friends.

Then one fateful night he propels his people into a race to modernize before they can be conquered by the Ones Above, invaders from the stars who want to exploit the Aviar.

A single fist wiping three behemoths off a planet— and with only two dead pilots— was considered a legendary feat. Before he departed, Abrill did her best to warn Zander that he’d likely be summoned to the Assembly. Zander was indeed summoned, and it was looking like he’d have to leave everyone else behind. It took Lavella interceding to buy enough time for Dreams to finish their upgrade so the whole crew could go. The trip included Lavella and Vakdreak, who also had business with the Assembly. Assembly Hub was even larger than MX Hub, being one of the two major Hubs. Zander’s tactics and actions were called into question, as well as rumors of him being a heretic to the Antecedents. Friends and foes took sides, but in the end, the Assembly voted to accept his new tactics. However, that didn’t stop the opposition for long. Zander’s new friendship with a lead pilot from another Assembly ship roped them and his allies from the Assembled Fist into a plan to crush Zander and his ideas. All three ships were given a new mission: to reclaim a lost world, an impossible task that had never been accomplished before. As the small strike fleet was set to leave, Zander got the approval from the captain in charge to lead all combat decisions for the mission. Zander knew he’d have to break the box more than he already had. A world swarmed by Entoma for years wouldn’t be simple to deal with, but he had options.

Isn’t it?  Since the Final War, I’ve been doing just fine. I have a lovely cave, a darling vegetable patch, forest views . . . and if loneliness sometimes squeezes my aching heart, well, my books have always kept me company.  That is, until a pack of hunters chase me from my home and right into the arms of several rather large, rather brutish ex-Army Rangers. And those brutes have the nerve to make me the rudest offer I’ve ever heard.  Their protection—for my body.  The whole thing is absurd. Scandalous. Perverted, even. I mean, just the thought of doing that with five men, well, it’s . . . it’s . . .  I take the deal.  Okay, so it’s possible I find them indecently tempting. But these men also have secrets, and pasts so fraught with emotion, I’m not sure I can untangle them all. Or whether they’ll let me.  No, my brutes have made it excruciatingly clear where they think I belong—beneath them, between them, bent over backwards for them . . . but certainly not beside them.  And I don’t think that’s going to work for me. ***  NOTE: Ensnared is book 1 of 3. This trilogy is now COMPLETE.

It is, above all, a way of asserting power.”— The New Yorker  In 1984, London is a grim city in the totalitarian state of Oceania where Big Brother is always watching you and the Thought Police can practically read your mind. Winston Smith is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be.  Lionel Trilling said of Orwell’s masterpiece, “ 1984 is a profound, terrifying, and wholly fascinating book. It is a fantasy of the political future, and like any such fantasy, serves its author as a magnifying device for an examination of the present.” Though the year 1984 now exists in the past, Orwell’s novel remains an urgent call for the individual willing to speak truth to power.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41gH8Q32oFL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JTHWKU,"[""Fantasy"",""Police"",""Forbidden Love""]","[""[#1 in Political Fiction (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/171129/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#1 in Classic British & Irish Fiction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/7588782011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#2 in Dystopian Fiction (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/3559311011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)""]","secret revolutionary organization profound, terrifying, and wholly fascinating book forbidden love affair",Third,true,true,true

The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window.

A freak accident. One man’s struggle to survive. From the author of Project Hail Mary comes “a hugely entertaining novel that reads like a rocket ship afire” (Chicago Tribune). “Brilliant . . . a celebration of human ingenuity [and] the purest example of real-science sci-fi for many years . . . utterly compelling.”— The Wall Street Journal Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there. After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next.

In the near future, a civil servant is offered the salary of her dreams and is, shortly afterward, told what project she’ll be working on. A recently established government ministry is gathering “expats” from across history to establish whether time travel is feasible—for the body, but also for the fabric of space-time. She is tasked with working as a “bridge”: living with, assisting, and monitoring the expat known as “1847” or Commander Graham Gore. As far as history is concerned, Commander Gore died on Sir John Franklin’s doomed 1845 expedition to the Arctic, so he’s a little disoriented to be living with an unmarried woman who regularly shows her calves, surrounded by outlandish concepts such as “washing machines,” “Spotify,” and “the collapse of the British Empire.” But with an appetite for discovery, a seven-a-day cigarette habit, and the support of a charming and chaotic cast of fellow expats, he soon adjusts. Over the next year, what the bridge initially thought would be, at best, a horrifically uncomfortable roommate dynamic, evolves into something much deeper. By the time the true shape of the Ministry’s project comes to light, the bridge has fallen haphazardly, fervently in love, with consequences she never could have imagined. Forced to confront the choices that brought them together, the bridge must finally reckon with how—and whether she believes—what she does next can change the future. An exquisitely original and feverishly fun fusion of genres and ideas, The Ministry of Time asks: What does it mean to defy history, when history is living in your house?

Four horsemen with the power to destroy all of humanity. They came to earth, and they came to end us all. When Pestilence comes for Sara Burn’s town, one thing is certain: everyone she knows and loves is marked for death. Unless, of course, the angelic-looking horseman is stopped, which is exactly what Sara has in mind when she shoots the unholy beast off his steed. Too bad no one told her Pestilence can’t be killed. Now the horseman, very much alive and very pissed off, has taken her prisoner, and he’s eager to make her suffer. Only, the longer she’s with him, the more uncertain she is about his true feelings towards her … and hers towards him. And now, well, Sara might still be able to save the world, but in order to do so, she'll have to sacrifice her heart in the process.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-+rlSlXOL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B6BRTJP,"[""Animals""]","[""[#10 in Post-Apocalyptic Science Fiction (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/7538386011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#18 in Post-Apocalyptic Science Fiction (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/6361471011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#26 in Fairy Tale Fantasy (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/169457011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)""]",Sara Burn’s town angelic-looking horseman,Third,false,false,true
