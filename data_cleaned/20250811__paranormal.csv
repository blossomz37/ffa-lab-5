(Let me just say...Hawk *swoon*!!)” ~ NYT bestseller Sarah J. Maas Captivating and action-packed, From Blood and Ash is a sexy, addictive, and unexpected fantasy perfect for fans of Sarah J. Maas and Rebecca Yarros.  A Maiden…  Chosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy’s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers.  A Duty…  The entire kingdom’s future rests on Poppy’s shoulders, something she’s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden.  A Kingdom…  Forsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel.

Mia’s husband is a great guy, but he’s basically the only orc I trust. One night, though, after a few too many happy hour shots and a full-on bar crawl, I stumble into an orc tattoo shop called Heat & Ink. Wherein a scarred, shirtless orc named Harken Overlord pulls me onto his chair. At first, I strangely enjoy the possessive touch of his big, rough hands. Then I scream when a hot branding iron lands on my... He licks my skin to take the hurt away. What the heck? The tiny tattoo of a cat I asked for is now Harken’s mark? I gasp with horror and blast him with all the salty language I can muster. As I slam out the front door of the shop, Harken thunders behind me, “You’ll be back, female, because you’re mine.” Uh huh.

Armentrout comes a new novel in her Blood and Ash series… Is Love Stronger Than Vengeance? A Betrayal… Everything Poppy has ever believed in is a lie, including the man she was falling in love with. Thrust among those who see her as a symbol of a monstrous kingdom, she barely knows who she is without the veil of the Maiden. But what she does know is that nothing is as dangerous to her as him. The Dark One. The Prince of Atlantia. He wants her to fight him, and that’s one order she’s more than happy to obey. He may have taken her, but he will never have her. A Choice…. Casteel Da’Neer is known by many names and many faces. His lies are as seductive as his touch. His truths as sensual as his bite. Poppy knows better than to trust him. He needs her alive, healthy, and whole to achieve his goals. But he’s the only way for her to get what she wants—to find her brother Ian and see for herself if he has become a soulless Ascended. Working with Casteel instead of against him presents its own risks. He still tempts her with every breath, offering up all she’s ever wanted. Casteel has plans for her. Ones that could expose her to unimaginable pleasure and unfathomable pain. Plans that will force her to look beyond everything she thought she knew about herself—about him. Plans that could bind their lives together in unexpected ways that neither kingdom is prepared for. And she’s far too reckless, too hungry, to resist the temptation. A Secret… But unrest has grown in Atlantia as they await the return of their Prince. Whispers of war have become stronger, and Poppy is at the very heart of it all. The King wants to use her to send a message. The Descenters want her dead. The wolven are growing more unpredictable. And as her abilities to feel pain and emotion begin to grow and strengthen, the Atlantians start to fear her. Dark secrets are at play, ones steeped in the blood-drenched sins of two kingdoms that would do anything to keep the truth hidden.

Would he be able to trust another alpha enough to be so open with him? When the Fates personally visit not only Todd but Briggs as well, the two choose not to fight the fact that they’re fated. It’s likely that the Fates know more than they do, and they need one another now. Will life calm down for these two, or will it only intensify? Briggs is Book Sixteen in the Paranormal Council Enforcers series. Each book in this series will focus on a different couple, but these books are not standalones and should be read in order as there is an ongoing backstory that won’t be resolved quickly. This is a fated mate story in an MPreg world, and there will be at least one baby.

Survivor of abuse, I'll claim because it's true, and I'm a survivor. But fated mate? That one feels like an ill-fitting glove.

So what's a girl to do? Bathe the stinky wolf if he's going to sneak into my bed and then play him Mozart until dawn. Obviously. But a fated mate connection is a once in a lifetime bond. And if he can't turn back into a man . . . will I be alone forever, even with him at my side? Dirge I've been on the run for so many years, I don't remember how to be a man, not really. But Shay calls to that part of me, the part I hid away so long ago. She's everything a man could want. Gorgeous, intelligent, and funny, all wrapped into a stunning, shyly sweet package.

Sera Swan used to be one of the most powerful witches in Britain. Then she resurrected her great-aunt Jasmine from the (very recently) dead, lost most of her magic, befriended a semi-villainous talking fox, and was exiled from her Guild. Now she (slightly reluctantly and just a bit grumpily) helps Jasmine run an enchanted inn in Lancashire, where she deals with her quirky guests' shenanigans, tries to keep said talking fox in check, and longs for the future that seems lost to her. But then she finds out about an old spell that could hold the key to restoring her power… Enter Luke Larsen, handsome and icy magical historian, who arrives on a dark winter evening and just might know how to unlock the spell’s secrets. Luke has absolutely no interest in getting involved in the madcap goings-on of the inn and is definitely not about to let a certain bewitching innkeeper past his walls, so no one is more surprised than he is when he agrees to help Sera with her spell. Worse, he might actually be thawing.

Bloodstone Academy is for strong, smart witches to hunt for their shifters, bond with them in the sacred forest, and fight with them in the war when they graduate. Only issue? Most students die from bonding, but that won’t stop me. Every generation of my family went to Bloodstone Academy, and it’s in my blood to thrive there. The witch war took my family, and I’m determined to help the Umbral Authority win. When I finally get the acceptance marking, I couldn’t be happier until I walk through the gothic doors and slam straight into a tall, stunningly beautiful dragon shifter…and he shoves me onto the floor in front of everyone. Bonding with a dragon shifter hasn’t been done in a hundred years…until I walk into the forest and four of them accidentally bond with me. Mazikeen Lycidas, Kane Ardian, Black Ashveil, Valeron Drexan are treated like gods at this academy— and they hate me. They never wanted to bond, and they don’t want to fight in the war. The four of them make my days at the academy hell, and the nights even worse. No spells are going to save me from them, not when we are pulled together by the bond. No magic will help me in the war if my shifters won’t fight. They say every dragon witch is cursed, and these four are all that is left in the world…and they are determined to ruin me.

But the cautionary tales were wrong, and they’re quick to learn demons don’t inspire terror but temptation… When a human’s fury meets a demon’s fire, hatred isn’t the only thing to ignite. Stolen from her prison cell and sold to slavers, Ember’s anger is all she has left to survive the nightmarish Achreos Barrens and its demonic inhabitants. Never mind her tenderly healed wounds and cozy cottage confines, she’s still being treated like a criminal. Her warden is a hardened soldier so hateful of humans that Ember stands no chance at exoneration. Sure, there may be moments when her demon jailor’s domestic ineptitude is endearing and his presence feels startlingly like security, but neither will stop her from provoking him and his disgusting tail. Squadron leader Severath has failed at his sole duty to protect his home. Burdened with guarding a killer and coping with the loss of an eye and horn, he’s rewarded only with the human’s ire. Judgement should be simple since she’s pled guilty, but her unbridled hostility feels like a façade. He should be fighting to reclaim his position on the guard and his solitary life rather than verbally sparring with such a menace, but he never thought his home could be so lively or that he might enjoy having a miniscule murderess torment him at every turn. Ember and Severath soon discover the border between animosity and affection is as thin as the veil between the human and demon worlds. Confined in close quarters, the two are forced to share their truths and confront their aversions to intimacy. But falling for a demon is dangerous, especially with Ember’s pending trial and Severath’s uncertain career. Will they land safely in the arms of their fledgling love or spiral into shared loathing? Falling for Demons is a fantasy monster romance series set in a cozy and spicy shared world by authors Laura Winter and A.K. Caggiano.

She will do anything to end Kolis, the false King of Gods, and his tyrannical rule of Iliseeum, thus stopping the threat he poses to the mortal realm. Nyktos has a plan, though, and as they work together, the last thing they need is the undeniable, scorching passion that continues to ignite between them. Sera cannot afford to fall for the tortured Primal, not when a life no longer bound to a destiny she never wanted is more attainable than ever. But memories of their shared pleasure and unrivaled desire are a siren's call impossible to resist. And as Sera begins to realize that she wants to be more than a Consort in name only, the danger surrounding them intensifies. The attacks on the Shadowlands are increasing, and when Kolis summons them to Court, a whole new risk becomes apparent. The Primal power of Life is growing inside her, pushing her closer to the end of her Culling. And without Nyktos's love—an emotion he's incapable of feeling—she won't survive her Ascension. That is if she even makes it to her Ascension and Kolis doesn't get to her first. Because time is running out. For both her and the realms.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HhTrfqHkL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YMS96FN,,"[""[#32 in Vampire Romances](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/16399311/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#34 in Paranormal Vampire Romance](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/6190488011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#93 in Romantasy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/7654406011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)""]",her Flesh and Fire series author Jennifer L.

While Sera is finally free of Kolis and back with those she loves, not everything is calm.

Nyktos desires, loves, and accepts every part of her—even the monstrous bits she still battles.

But she must find that faith within herself if they hope to convince the other Courts to support them against Kolis and make Iliseeum and the mortal realm better, safer places for all. But as Sera begins to piece together the importance of her bloodline and the true meaning behind the foreboding prophecy, it becomes clear that everything that has happened and is yet to come is much bigger than Kolis and his dark obsessions.

A battle between the gods is brewing, and heartbreaking losses are imminent with the true Primal of Death strengthening.
