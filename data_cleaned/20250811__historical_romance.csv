Massachusetts Bay Colony, 1646. Thomas and Margaret Jones arrive from England to build a life in the New World. Though of differing temperaments, cautious Thomas and fiery Margaret, a healer, are bound by a love that has lasted decades. With a child on the way, their new beginning promises only blessings.  But in this austere Puritan community, comely faces hide malicious intent. Wrong moves or words are met with suspicion, and Margaret’s bold and unguarded nature draws scorn. Soon, Margaret is mistrusted as more cunning woman than kind caregiver. And when personal tragedies, religious hysteria, and wariness of the unknown turn most against her, even the devotion Margaret and her husband share is at risk.  Inspired by actual diary entries and court records, The First Witch of Boston is at once the riveting story of a woman unjustly accused and a love story set amid the political and social turmoil of both Old and New England. Harrowing, and with a deep understanding of the human heart, history is brilliantly imagined.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+Y8u4+p0L._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8NTCJ7,"[""Supernatural"",""Witch"",""Religious""]","[""[#1 in Women's Historical Fiction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/7588889011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#1 in Historical Fiction (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/10177/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#1 in American Historical Romance (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/13372/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)""]",austere Puritan community seventeenth-century Massachusetts Margaret’s bold and unguarded nature gripping and intimate novel political and social turmoil,Third,true,false,true

Robert Durham, the Duke of Durham, has loved Lady Fiona Shoreham ever since he was a little boy. But he is six years her junior and had to watch helplessly as eighteen-year-old Fiona married the Earl of Shoreham. She is a widow now and lovelier than ever. He is a man fully grown, considered one of the elite Silver Dukes, known to all as rakehells who will never marry. But Society could not be more wrong about him, for this duke fully intends to claim Fiona as his own. Lady Fiona Shoreham has never considered remarrying, especially not to a younger man. She has known the impossibly handsome Duke of Durham ever since they were children, but what was once a true and sincere youthful friendship has blossomed into so much more. However, she dares not give in to her heart and admit she loves him, for he is the last in the Durham line and must sire heirs. In almost twenty years of marriage, she and her late husband never had children, a failing everyone has blamed on her. How can she agree to marry the Duke of Durham when she will never be able to give him the one thing he needs? A compromise is the answer, or so Fiona believes. She is offering this handsome duke one week in her bed. One week only, and then they must move on. But Robert will have none of it. He knows what he needs, and it is Fiona for a lifetime. What will it take to convince her?

Yet the thought of navigating London's marriage mart in search of a suitable bride holds no appeal for his tortured soul. When an unexpected offer arrives for his eldest daughter Grace, Reverend Shackleford can scarcely believe their good fortune. Of course, describing Grace as ""respectful,"" ""meek,"" or ""dutiful"" required significant creative interpretation of those terms—but surely the duke needn't discover this immediately? What the Reverend never anticipated was how his daughter's spirited nature might not only capture the wounded duke's heart but potentially bring scandal raining down upon them all. As Grace's rebellious spirit clashes with Nicholas's carefully constructed walls, both discover that healing—and love—may come from the most unexpected quarters. A #1 Bestseller in Regency Historical Romance on Amazon, this first instalment in the Shackleford Sisters series delivers the perfect blend of witty banter, tender moments, and the sparkling charm of Regency England. Perfect for fans of Julia Quinn, Lisa Kleypas, and anyone who enjoys historical romance with humour and heart. Note: While this novel doesn't contain an excessive number of spicy scenes, it isn't closed-door and wouldn't be considered ""clean"" romance.  Praise for the Shackleford Sisters:  “I’ve read every one of the Shackleford Sisters books. I read a lot, and I enjoyed these books more than anything I have read in a very long time.” “I have enjoyed this series SO much.

Jonas Langford, Duke of Ramsdale, knows he is a beast and no one can possibly love him. He was the ton’s most eligible and desired bachelor before the Napoleonic War left him horribly scarred and had him retreating to Langford Hall in the quiet Yorkshire village of Broadmoor to live out his life in solitude. That is, until one Miss Ailis Temple, the beautiful spinster he thinks of as Miss Temple of Virtue, tumbles off her horse in front of his home and dislocates her shoulder. What else is a duke to do with a snowstorm approaching but take her in and tend to her wounds? She came to him seeking charity contributions for the local vicarage, however he strikes a bargain with her. She is to give him ten kisses, a hundred pounds a kiss, he says, never believing she will accept his terms. But she does, and Jonas realizes his life may never be the same again. Although Ailis is the one with the injured shoulder, is it possible he is the one who will be healed by her love? Ten kisses, this is the bargain Ailis Temple, a beautiful spinster who has never dipped a toe out of line, strikes with the dangerously daunting Duke of Ramsdale in exchange for his charity donation. Dear heaven, what has she done? The duke is big and muscled, built like a warrior, and never smiles. But he has the sinful look of a man who knows how to kiss, and she, having never been kissed, is not about to pass up the opportunity. However, neither of them expected her to fall off her horse and be injured in front of his home, nor did they plan on the impending snowstorm to trap her with him for days.

The spa town of Little Valentine is a charming and sleepy seaside destination, a place the middle classes retire to and the elderly visit to drink the waters. It is far from fashionable and offers none of the entertainment that Beau considers essential to endure another dull day. Yet Little Valentine is where the earl finds himself, having escaped an untimely death. Beau is well aware his cousin is the culprit, though just how he administered the poison, he cannot fathom. But he is all that stands between his cousin Edwin and the earldom. Tired of waiting for his wicked relation to drink or debauch himself into an early grave, Edwin has taken matters into his own hands. Yet he had not reckoned on Kirby, Beau’s devoted valet. The ex-prizefighter hauls his lord and master out of harm’s way to recuperate in a place where no one will think to look for him. Sadly, still suffering the ill effects of his cousin’s toxic attentions, Beau makes an immediate impression upon the community, and especially Miss Clementine Honeywell, by vomiting over her shoes. Miss Honeywell is the eldest daughter of a kindly, if disorganised, vicar, and well used to taking charge of a situation. The arrival of the notorious Earl of Beaumarsh is certainly a circumstance that needs immediate attention.

Welcome to life in the shadow of Cairnfell. Lady Isla Kinsey knows that the animosity between her family, the Dukedom of Grayburn, and their distant kinsmen, the Earldom of Northcairn, is the stuff of legends—six generations of duels fought, ladies ruined, and gentlemen betrayed. Therefore, falling in love with a son of the enemy house would be, in a word, apocalyptic. So when Captain Tavish Balfour, second son of the Earl of Northcairn, returns home after Waterloo—distressingly handsome with eyes that see straight into her soul—Lady Isla is determined to resist his allure. She will not fall in love with the rogue . . . uh-hum, again. Granted, the not-falling-in-love part would be a tad bit easier if Isla and Tavish weren’t already married. Captain Tavish Balfour has cashed out of his military commission and is ready to start a new life far away from the Scottish Highlands of his birth. But before he sets sail into his future, there is the pesky matter of his marriage to Lady Isla Kinsey to resolve. As teenagers, in the sun-drenched warmth of a Highland summer, they tied the knot of their handfasting—an ill-advised decision he has regretted ever since. Thankfully, unlike their English neighbors, Scottish law allows for divorce in situations such as theirs. Unfortunately for Tavish, Isla is every whit as captivating and lovely as his memories recall. As for Isla, she fears Tavish will reawaken the unconventional woman she was becoming all those years ago. Yet even if they were to fall in love again, what could come of it? The history of acrimony between their families still casts a long shadow, and the forces that shredded their love in the past have not miraculously changed since.

He’d truly believed that in marrying his eldest daughter Grace to an extremely wealthy peer of the realm, his problems would be over. But as the Reverend was now beginning to realise, it wasn’t sufficient to have a wealthy Duke in the family if the daughter he was trying to marry off had the manners of a stable hand. And to Reverend Shackleford’s knowledge, his second eldest daughter Temperance’s version of modest reserve was making sure to kick a miscreant in the shins rather than his ballocks. Put simply, Temperance was the exact opposite of her name and a harpy to boot. In fact the Reverend very much feared that unless he could find someone to teach her at the very least how to hold her temper, he would be stuck with her forever. But as he was always telling his curate, the Almighty works in mysterious ways. Indeed, Reverend Shackleford believed his prayers were finally answered when he found the very person to take Temperance in hand. Lady Gertrude Fotheringale was genteel, discreet and suitably impoverished. Or so he thought… Adam Colbourne, the eighth Earl of Ravenstone had no intention of taking a wife. As a boy he’d witnessed the cold, impersonal, not to mention loveless, nature of his parents’ union. Marriage he concluded, was not anything he wished to experience. And the scheming matchmaking mothers of each Season’s crop of debutantes in no way gave him any reason to change his mind. That was until a chance meeting with a foul mouthed raven-haired termagant, who in the space of one night turned his world entirely upside down… Perfect for fans of Regency Romances with wit and humor and a little bit of steam. Praise for the Shackleford Sisters: ‘Very funny, kept laughing out loud when reading them.’ ‘Such an entertaining series, full of laughter and delightfully quirky characters.’ ‘Terrific series, very funny.’ ‘Thoroughly enjoyed this series, love the humour.’ ‘There is constant action and so much funny banter, I couldn’t help laughing.’ ‘These were wonderful.

She certainly wasn’t expecting to be intrigued by the forlorn empty house situated next to their own elegant villa, especially when she discovered it belonged to a handsome captain in the Royal Navy who was currently away at sea. Unfortunately, she never imagined that fascination might cost her her life. Roan Carew grew up an orphan on the streets of Torquay, until he was press ganged into the Royal Navy at eleven. Through a combination of determination, shrewdness and sheer bloody mindedness he rose to the rank of Captain, but he was certainly no gentleman nor ever would be. Indeed, his purchase of Redstone House, a rundown mansion in Torquay’s wealthiest district was more of an impulse than an aspiration towards respectability. He most certainly did not expect the house to come with a thirty-year-old secret that someone was prepared to commit murder to protect. Naturally Reverend Shackleford, who it was generally agreed would be 'in if he fell in,’ simply had to investigate… Perfect for fans of Regency Romances with wit and humor and a little bit of steam.

The Duke of Brandon is London’s most infamous rake. But his world crashes to a decided halt when the sins of his past come back to haunt him in the form of one small she-devil of a child who has green eyes just like his. To make matters worse, his disapproving grandmother has decided he must marry or forfeit his inheritance. Now, he has no choice but to raise a daughter, find a suitable wife, and keep his harridan grandmother from discovering his sordid secrets as founder of the Wicked Dukes Society. So when the tempting, fiery-haired Countess of Grenfell propositions him, he offers her something else instead—a marriage of convenience. Lottie, Countess of Grenfell, is London’s most notorious widow. Her doomed, one-sided marriage left her with a broken heart and a determination never to wed again. What she wants is simple—passion, independence, and one night in the Duke of Brandon’s bed. Or in his scandalous chair. Perhaps even against a wall. She wouldn’t marry him, however, if he were the last man on earth. Brandon is quickly running out of time. He must persuade Lottie to become his duchess with all haste or risk losing everything. As he sets out to seduce her into marriage, he’s shocked to realize he’s done the one thing he previously believed himself incapable of along the way—he’s fallen in love.

Mainly because everyone who knew him or of him almost certainly believed him dead - the bastard who’d betrayed him had made sure of that. His only hope was to seek aid from Nicholas Sinclair, his former mentor, now the current Duke of Blackmore, before his enemies realised that news of his demise had been greatly exaggerated. Unfortunately, on finally reaching the Duke’s estate late on Christmas eve, Atwood discovered the house shrouded in darkness and realised with despair that his grace had undoubtedly chosen to spend the Christmas season elsewhere. Hope Shackleford did not relish spending the festive season under the same roof as her entire family, even though the roof beneath which the gathering was to take place belonged to the Earl of Ravenstone and was far grander than the modest vicarage in which she’d spent her whole life. Indeed, given that her two eldest sisters were married to influential members of the ton, it had to be said that her family were becoming increasingly accustomed to indulgences entirely above their station. Hope on the other hand, despite possessing a head of flaming red hair giving indication to the contrary, was a practical young woman who eschewed both whimsy and optimism, unlike the rest of her eccentric family - in particular her father whose calling as a man of the cloth seemed in recent years to play a secondary role to his passion for meddling in affairs that in Hope’s view were entirely none of his business. Thus, the chances of their Christmas festivities being wholly focused on the simple joys of the season were, in Hope’s opinion, slim to none. After the unexpected appearance of a handsome vagrant who was clearly more than he seemed, Hope had no idea just how correct her misgivings would turn out to be… Perfect for fans of Regency Romances with wit and humor and a little bit of steam. Praise for the Shackleford Sisters: ‘Very funny, kept laughing out loud when reading them.’ ‘Such an entertaining series, full of laughter and delightfully quirky characters.’ ‘Terrific series, very funny.’ ‘Thoroughly enjoyed this series, love the humour.’ ‘There is constant action and so much funny banter, I couldn’t help laughing.’ ‘These were wonderful.

Fitzwilliam Darcy arrives at the Gardiners' leased seaside cottage prepared to reclaim his sister and confront her would-be seducer. Instead, he finds himself caught off guard by the quick wit, steady nerve, and captivating spirit of the young woman who intervened on Georgiana’s behalf. From the moment Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy, her heart begins its quiet surrender. But when she dares to hope for his affection in return, she finds herself facing a man torn between his growing desire and his deep-rooted sense of duty. Though clearly drawn to her, Darcy resists, determined to suppress what he feels and protect them both from the consequences of a misalliance. Elizabeth, unwilling to beg for a love she already knows is hers, chooses to walk away. Meanwhile, at Longbourn, Frances Bennet discovers that Lydia is with child, and she and Mr. Bennet are forced to reckon with more than just disgrace—they must learn to work together, perhaps for the first time, to preserve the future of their family. In the face of shame, uncertainty, and society’s unforgiving eye, both parents find strength where it has long lain dormant. While Elizabeth and Darcy’s story lies at the center of this tender reimagining, each of the Bennet sisters must also find her own way. Set against the backdrop of Regency England and steeped in longing, wit, and emotional complexity, To Have and To Hold offers readers a deeper look into the choices, sacrifices, and triumphs that define love and family. This variation departs from canon to explore themes of courtship, marriage, and a woman’s right to self-protection. Set in the Regency era, it imagines a world where women enjoy greater freedom and agency. The story weaves in subtle romantic elements and, at times, touches gently on the private intimacies of married life. While these moments are portrayed with discretion and sensitivity, readers who prefer to avoid stories with sensual undertones may wish to proceed with care. For those who delight in a more emotionally intimate Darcy and Elizabeth, and who enjoy a blend of loyalty, personal growth, and romantic tension, To Have and To Hold is a moving and memorable variation inspired by Jane Austen’s timeless tale.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41PnuCr39+L._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FHWW4FGC,"[""Pregnancy"",""Regency"",""JAFF""]","[""[#9 in Historical British Fiction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/7588806011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#29 in Historical British & Irish Literature](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/10090/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#31 in Historical Regency Fiction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/7588801011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)""]",more emotionally intimate Darcy his deep-rooted sense her would-be seducer Jane Austen’s timeless tale woman’s right A Pride and Prejudice Variation society’s unforgiving eye moving and memorable variation Gardiners' leased seaside cottage girl's formidable brother,Third,false,true,true
