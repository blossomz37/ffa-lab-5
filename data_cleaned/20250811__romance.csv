Do not touch the sword. Do not turn the key. Do not open the gate. Twenty-four-year-old Saeris Fane is good at keeping secrets. No one knows about the strange powers she possesses, or the fact that she has been picking pockets and stealing from the Undying Queen’s reservoirs for as long as she can remember. In the land of the unforgiving desert, there isn’t much a girl wouldn’t do for a glass of water. But a secret is like a knot. Sooner or later, it is bound to come undone. When Saeris comes face-to-face with Death himself, she inadvertently reopens a gateway between realms and is transported to a land of ice and snow. The Fae have always been the stuff of myth, of legend, of nightmares…but it turns out they’re real, and Saeris has landed right in the middle of a centuries-long conflict that might just get her killed. The first of her kind to tread the frozen mountains of Yvelia in over a thousand years, Saeris mistakenly binds herself to Kingfisher, a handsome Fae warrior, who has secrets and nefarious agendas of his own. He will use her Alchemist’s magic to protect his people, no matter what it costs him… or her. Death has a name. It is Kingfisher of the Ajun Gate. His past is murky. His attitude stinks. And he’s the only way Saeris is going to make it home. Be careful of the deals you make, dear child. The devil is in the details...

They claim I’m their “prize.” Not for blackmail. Not for leverage. But for love. Love? As if. Except… they’re relentless. Hilarious. Disarming in ways I never saw coming. And under all that bravado? They’re tender in a way that threatens to break through every wall I’ve ever built. For the first time, I’m not sure I want to win this game alone. Because maybe love isn’t about control.

REWARD OFFERED: Apprentice to The Villain wanted for treason (light), magical property damage (alleged), and one incident involving a weaponized scone (accurate). Frequently seen with a grumpy frog (crowned, judgmental). Answers to “Evie” or “Stop that.” Evie Sage didn’t mean to become the right-hand woman to the kingdom’s most terrifying villain. One minute, she was applying for an entry-level position that promised “light paperwork and occasional beheadings,” and the next, she was knee-deep in magical mayhem, murder plots, and an entirely inappropriate crush on her brooding, sharp-jawed, walking disaster of a boss. Now, with a magical prophecy unraveling, assassins showing up in the break room, and a suspicious amount of frogs wearing crowns, Evie has to figure out how to survive her job without setting the kingdom on fire—or her dignity, which is hanging by a very sarcastic thread. Being evil-adjacent was never part of the five-year plan. But then again…neither was falling for The Villain. A magical office comedy with grumpy bosses, snarky frogs, and definitely-not-feelings.

With her flourishing career as an author, and the inheritance of her late grandmother’s gothic mansion, there is nothing to stand in her way. But Adeline isn’t alone in Parson’s Manor. It isn’t the angry souls haunting the hallways of her childhood home that Adeline fears–it’s the mysterious break-ins, roses appearing, and threatening messages that somehow sound more like eerie promises. Adeline has a stalker. Yet, she quickly discovers she’s not the first person in her family to fall victim to a shadow in pursuit. Left behind are her great-grandmother’s haunting journals detailing the story of her own phantom, and subsequently, her brutal murder. Parson’s Manor now holds more than just Adeline’s memories—it houses a grim future that could lead to history repeating itself. If she doesn’t fall in love with her stalker first. While not required, it is highly suggested to read the novella, Satan's Affair, first. Author's Note: This book ends on a cliffhanger. For CWs, please check the author's website.

I want to get under his skin.  One look at single dad Callum Blackwood, and I know I messed up. I never meant to save a farm—or steal it from under the grumpy innkeeper who had already claimed it as his future.  Now I’m the woman who swooped in on a whim and left him seething.  Trouble is, I have no idea what I’m doing.  Every smirk, every biting comment, is a reminder that he’s waiting for me to fail. But I don’t back down from a fight— even when the fight comes with a jawline that should be illegal and a scowl that sets my pulse racing.  Tempers flare, but when the lines between rivals and lovers begin to blur, I start to see him in a different light. The longer we go toe-to-toe, the more I understand the man behind the scowl. The one who loves his kid fiercely, who carries the weight of the world on his shoulders, who looks at me like I’m the reason the sun rises.  Cal’s wrong if he thinks I’ll give up on this farm. He’s even more wrong if he thinks I’ll give up on him.

They say you can never go home again, and for Persephone Fraser, ever since she made the biggest mistake of her life a decade ago, that has felt too true. Instead of glittering summers on the lakeshore of her childhood, she spends them in a stylish apartment in the city, going out with friends, and keeping everyone a safe distance from her heart. Until she receives the call that sends her racing back to Barry’s Bay and into the orbit of Sam Florek—the man she never thought she’d have to live without. For six summers, through hazy afternoons on the water and warm summer nights working in his family’s restaurant and curling up together with books—medical textbooks for him and work-in-progress horror short stories for her—Percy and Sam had been inseparable. Eventually that friendship turned into something breathtakingly more, before it fell spectacularly apart. When Percy returns to the lake for Sam’s mother’s funeral, their connection is as undeniable as it had always been. But until Percy can confront the decisions she made and the years she’s spent punishing herself for them, they’ll never know whether their love might be bigger than the biggest mistakes of their past.

Having failed (and failed some more) to deliver her new manuscript, she’s hiding from the world behind a wall of old takeout containers until her publisher lays down the law. If she misses her next deadline it’s The End. Desperate for inspiration, Hazel impulse-buys a historic home online and flees Manhattan to tiny Story Lake, PA. Upon her dramatic arrival—involving an incident with a bald eagle—she discovers the charm of her new home may have been slightly exaggerated. The house is a wreck and the town is struggling after their biggest employer shut down.

Now I’m choosing my own path… even if it means war. In Blackberry Burrow, females like me were nothing more than property, used to breed and controlled by rules I didn’t agree to. With my first heat due any day, the rabbit shifter men had already started negotiating who would be sharing my bed, like I was nothing more than a toy for their amusement. I’d rather mop a bathroom floor with my tongue than let that happen. With the help of my best friend Fletcher, I ran—straight into the arms of two very large, very dangerous, and very growly wolf shifters. Linc and Copeland didn’t just protect me; they claimed me. Alongside Fletcher, they became my mates. My future. My family. But peace doesn’t last long when your past wants you back… dead or alive. The burrow has a plan to get their revenge, and my mates are their first targets. When I left, I promised myself I’d die before ever stepping foot on burrow land again. But now I’m going back to the place that caged me. Armed with a plan, determination, and a whole lot of rage, I’m ready to bop a few bunnies on the head if it means saving my mates.

In accordance with wolf law, that makes her his property. Now, he wants her back.  To beat him and take his throne, Aurora and Callum must form a dangerous alliance with one of the most feared Wolves in the Kingdom, Blake. He is their enemy, but he has entangled his life with Aurora’s—meaning she cannot harm him without forfeiting her own life.  As she fights to break their connection, she suspects Blake is keeping secrets about a dark power that rises in the north, and the unsettling nature of the bond between them. It seems there is a bigger game at play than who sits on the Wolf Throne—one that threatens both the Kingdom of Wolves, and the Kingdom of Men.  With her wolf awakening, enemies closing in, relationships tested, and secrets revealed—Aurora may be the only one who can stop an ancient evil from rising.  If she can figure out who to trust.  If she can figure out where she, and her heart, belong.  If she can stay alive. The highly anticipated sequel to The Wolf King.

At the age of twenty-nine, Hannah Martin still has no idea what she wants to do with her life. She has lived in six different cities and held countless meaningless jobs since graduating college. On the heels of leaving yet another city, Hannah moves back to her hometown of Los Angeles and takes up residence in her best friend Gabby’s guestroom. Shortly after getting back to town, Hannah goes out to a bar one night with Gabby and meets up with her high school boyfriend, Ethan. Just after midnight, Gabby asks Hannah if she’s ready to go. A moment later, Ethan offers to give her a ride later if she wants to stay. Hannah hesitates. What happens if she leaves with Gabby? What happens if she leaves with Ethan? In concurrent storylines, Hannah lives out the effects of each decision. Quickly, these parallel universes develop into radically different stories with large-scale consequences for Hannah, as well as the people around her.

Twenty-eight-year-old Georgia Stanton has to start over after she gave up almost everything in a brutal divorce—the New York house, the friends, and her pride. Now back home at her late great-grandmother’s estate in Colorado, she finds herself face-to-face with Noah Harrison, the bestselling author of a million books where the cover is always people nearly kissing. He’s just as arrogant in person as in interviews, and she’ll be damned if the good-looking writer of love stories thinks he’s the one to finish her grandmother’s final novel…even if the publisher swears he’s the perfect fit. Noah is at the pinnacle of his career. With book and movie deals galore, there isn’t much the “golden boy” of modern fiction hasn’t accomplished. But he can’t walk away from what might be the best book of the century—the one his idol, Scarlett Stanton, left unfinished. Coming up with a fitting ending for the legendary author is one thing, but dealing with her beautiful, stubborn, cynical great-granddaughter, Georgia, is quite another. But as they read Scarlett’s words in both the manuscript and her box of letters, they start to realize why Scarlett never finished the book—it’s based on her real-life romance with a World War II pilot, and the ending isn’t a happy one. Georgia knows all too well that love never works out, and while the chemistry and connection between her and Noah is undeniable, she’s as determined as ever to learn from her great-grandmother’s mistakes—even if it means destroying Noah’s career.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41iIv8dgXUL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087VXZYMM,,"[""[#6 in Contemporary Romance (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/13354/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#37 in Contemporary Romance (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/158568011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#64 in Romance (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/12527147011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)""]","her late great-grandmother’s estate good-looking writer New York house her great-grandmother’s mistakes Twenty-eight-year-old Georgia Stanton her grandmother’s final novel book and movie deals her beautiful, stubborn, cynical great-granddaughter her real-life romance “golden boy World War II pilot",Third,false,false,true

Too bad she comes to the attention of the three ruthless, arrogant commanders of the Ruby Dragon Society. Three of the most feared and powerful vampires on campus. But Ophelia doesn’t believe in vampires. Or in witches, or magic, or ancient prophecies. Until she has no choice. Little does she know, she’s about to have her whole world turned upside down. Because there is something about Ophelia Hart. Something that captures not only the attention of the Ruby Dragon commanders, but also their powerful, enigmatic sire—Professor Alexandros Drakos. With no idea of the power running through her veins, Ophelia must learn to trust the very men whom all others fear. And she needs to do it fast, for there are darker forces at work than those at Montridge University. Forces that were long ago Forged in Blood. Forged in Blood is book one in a trilogy.
