""Daniel Silva spins a yarn better than any living author and I appreciated the chance to disappear into a great book, if only for a single night (there is no stopping a Silva book once I've begun). --Todd Wilkins, Best Thriller Books  Sometimes the only way to recover a stolen masterpiece is to steal it back . . .  Gabriel Allon has been awarded a commission to restore one of the most important paintings in Venice. But when he discovers the body of a mysterious woman floating in the waters of the Venetian Lagoon, he finds himself in a desperate race to recover a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci.  The painting, a portrait of a beautiful young girl, has been gathering dust in a storeroom at the Vatican Museums for more than a century, misattributed and hidden beneath a worthless picture by an unknown artist. Because no one knows that the Leonardo is there, no one notices when it disappears one night during a suspicious power outage. No one but the ruthless mobsters and moneymen behind the theft -- and the mysterious woman whom Gabriel found in a watery grave in Venice. A woman without a name. A woman without a face.  The action moves at breakneck speed from the galleries and auction houses of London to an enclave of unimaginable wealth on the French Riviera -- and, finally, to a shocking climax in St. Peter's Square, where the life of a pope hangs in the balance.

With her flourishing career as an author, and the inheritance of her late grandmother’s gothic mansion, there is nothing to stand in her way. But Adeline isn’t alone in Parson’s Manor. It isn’t the angry souls haunting the hallways of her childhood home that Adeline fears–it’s the mysterious break-ins, roses appearing, and threatening messages that somehow sound more like eerie promises. Adeline has a stalker. Yet, she quickly discovers she’s not the first person in her family to fall victim to a shadow in pursuit. Left behind are her great-grandmother’s haunting journals detailing the story of her own phantom, and subsequently, her brutal murder. Parson’s Manor now holds more than just Adeline’s memories—it houses a grim future that could lead to history repeating itself. If she doesn’t fall in love with her stalker first.

When the Cassidy-Shaws’ autonomous minivan collides with an oncoming car, seventeen-year-old Charlie is in the driver’s seat, with his father, Noah, riding shotgun. In the back seat, tweens Alice and Izzy are on their phones, while their mother, Lorelei, a world leader in the field of artificial intelligence, is absorbed in her work. Yet each family member harbors a secret, implicating them all in the tragic accident.  During a weeklong recuperation on the Chesapeake Bay, the family confronts the excruciating moral dilemmas triggered by the crash. Noah tries to hold the family together as a seemingly routine police investigation jeopardizes Charlie’s future. Alice and Izzy turn strangely furtive. And Lorelei’s odd behavior tugs at Noah’s suspicions that there is a darker truth behind the incident—suspicions heightened by the sudden intrusion of Daniel Monet, a tech mogul whose mysterious history with Lorelei hints at betrayal. When Charlie falls for Monet’s teenaged daughter, the stakes are raised even higher in this propulsive family drama that is also a fascinating exploration of the moral responsibility and ethical consequences of AI.  Culpability explores a world newly shaped by chatbots, autonomous cars, drones, and other nonhuman forces in ways that are thrilling, challenging, and unimaginably provocative.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51suWIg3jhL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DT6ZMKXQ,"[""Suspense"",""Police"",""Mystery""]","[""[#15 in Psychological Fiction (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/18289231011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#16 in Domestic Thrillers (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/17744539011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#25 in Psychological Thrillers (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/10491/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)""]",Monet’s teenaged daughter Lorelei’s odd behavior tugs propulsive family drama seventeen-year-old Charlie driver’s seat excruciating moral dilemmas seemingly routine police investigation NATIONAL BESTSELLER • A suspenseful family drama OPRAH'S BOOK CLUB PICK,Third,false,false,true

When Sloan Booker’s father dies tragically, he has no other option but to give up his job as an FBI agent and take over his family’s vehicle restoration business in Oahu, Hawaii. Giving up his badge is difficult but having Homeland Security and his old boss request the use of his house in a stakeout, spying on his Muslim neighbors who they suspect are terrorists, is just too damn much for a man already frazzled. It makes no difference that they’ve offered him a partner to be in charge of the surveillance… until he meets the gorgeous divorcee. Special Agent Alia Hawkins might look more like a model than a cop but looks can be deceiving. Not only does she rescue street kids, fights their battles, and transports them to safe homes, but since she lived many years in Pakistan and speaks their language, she’s a sought-after agent. So far, she’s kept her personal life and job separate. But when Alia’s slimy ex-husband threatens to steal her eight-year-old son, she has no choice but to bring him along on her latest undercover assignment – living with a hotshot, sexy-as-hell agent as his long-lost stepsister.

In a tight-knit town in the 1980s, a child-killer is on the loose. And Topaz’s parents are on edge. At ten years old, Topaz is so vulnerable. But she has nothing to worry about. Her eldest sister, Ruby, has made sure of that. Swearing Topaz to secrecy, Ruby reveals she has trapped the monster in their root cellar.  Bound and bloodied in the cold space is kindly Brother Johnson from the Church. Pleading with Topaz to cut him loose, he says her reckless sister is a liar. Brother Johnson is right about that: Ruby does lie. She also likes to scare people. Still, even Ruby wouldn’t lie about this. Would she? The game—and the secret—is in her hands.

And in the calm before the storm, big-city lawyer Dean Lincoln finds himself defending Haley Finch, a beautiful young woman accused of murdering her older boyfriend. Her supposed motive? He’d just won big on the lottery—and then changed his will in her favor.

But Lincoln knows nothing is ever quite as it seems down here, and once again finds himself scratching beneath the cracked veneer of the famous Southern charm.

I'm already dying to see Charlie Hall's next con."" - New York Times bestselling author, Alix E. Harrow #1 New York Times bestselling author Holly Black makes her stunning adult debut with Book of Night, a modern dark fantasy of betrayals, secret societies, and a dissolute thief of shadows, in the vein of Neil Gaiman and Erin Morgenstern. Charlie Hall has never found a lock she couldn’t pick, a book she couldn’t steal, or a bad decision she wouldn’t make. She's spent half her life working for gloamists, magicians who manipulate shadows to peer into locked rooms, strangle people in their beds, or worse. Gloamists guard their secrets greedily, creating an underground economy of grimoires. And to rob their fellow magicians, they need Charlie Hall. Now, she’s trying to distance herself from past mistakes, but getting out isn’t easy. Bartending at a dive, she’s still entirely too close to the corrupt underbelly of the Berkshires. Not to mention that her sister Posey is desperate for magic, and that Charlie's shadowless, and possibly soulless, boyfriend has been hiding things from her. When a terrible figure from her past returns, Charlie descends into a maelstrom of murder and lies. Determined to survive, she’s up against a cast of doppelgangers, mercurial billionaires, gloamists, and the people she loves best in the world—all trying to steal a secret that will give them vast and terrible power.
