Instead, I got abducted by aliens—and stranded on a desert planet that wants me dead.  My name is Justine Parker, and I was desperate. Rent was due, my sister and I were one eviction away from living on the streets, and the job market had collapsed after the Xyma arrived. So when I saw an ad offering ten grand just for participating in ""environmental adaptation research,"" I didn’t read the fine print.  Big mistake.  Next thing I know, I’m waking up in a crashed transport pod on a hellscape of a planet—no water, no supplies, just endless sand and a sun that wants to cook me alive. And then he finds me.  Rok is seven feet of golden-skinned, battle-scarred alien warrior with a glare that could melt steel. He moves like a predator, speaks in growls, and—apparently—thinks I belong to him.  Turns out, I’m the first female he’s ever seen. And now that he’s imprinted on me, he won’t let me out of his sight.  Worse? His body adapts to me. Literally.  At first, he was just a terrifying, silent guardian. Now? He’s got a very specific upgrade—one that makes my knees weak and my common sense disappear. Every touch, every growl, every possessive glance sends heat straight to my core.  But this planet isn’t done trying to kill me. Between sand serpents, rival clans, and whatever nightmare lurks in the Silent Valley where my sister is trapped, survival is anything but guaranteed.  Rok says he’ll protect me.

I vowed to forget him…if only I could. When I was a child, I fell in love with a Dakkari boy. The prince of our clan. Rukkar, we called him. For he was destined to become the greatest horde king of our time. He was Kiran of Rath Okkili. My friend. My strong, unyielding protector. His mischievous smile and golden eyes made my heart flutter and my soul sing. And just when I began to believe he returned my love…he shattered me so completely and never once looked back to see how I’d survived. Nine years later, he’s returned. Only, he’s not a prince anymore. He’s a horde king. Cold and cruel. With molten eyes like sin and a body made for war. I’d promised myself I’d never love him again. I’m older, wiser, and I protect my heart at all costs. But he’s driven to prove me wrong for reasons I don’t understand. Because not only does he want my love again…he also demands me as his queen.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HXmG7to6L._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096C7LMHJ,,"[""[#87 in Science Fiction Romance (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/7654408011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#91 in Science Fiction Romance (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/6401744011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#219 in Action & Adventure Romance (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/11650866011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)""]",greatest horde king,First,false,false,true

There are no servers, no menus — do mind our hostess, though, she can get a bit underfoot! Help yourself to a book while you wait, and be sure to shuffle your tarot deck well before placing your order. Harper Hollingsworth wasn’t looking for a friend. She wanted peace and quiet. Someplace to lose herself in a book and not think about her grief, not think about her coven or her disconnect from the craft, not think about being the odd goth out everywhere she went. She didn't want to think about her lack of magical ambition, as she was regularly told by her mother's poison-tongued familiar, and how her life had fallen apart since the death of her father. More than that — she didn't want to feel. Anything. To the strange, seldom seen owner of one of Cambric Creek's oddest businesses, tea is more than just a beverage. They take pride in both their blends and their unorthodox method of teasing out the order each guest needs to sate more than their thirst. Azathé brews more than a fine cup of tea — they steep the smell of memories, the anticipation of the future, pain and loss, hope and longing, an elixir of health and comfort and feeling in every cup. Residing unseen in the shadows gets a bit lonely at times, an undignified emotion for one as old as themselves, and so they have made it their business to get to know their unwitting neighbors one cup of tea at a time. Guests may not know what to expect when they step over the shop's threshold, but the owner guarantees they will feel something before they leave. Companionship wasn’t Harper's aim the day she stepped into the odd little tea room, just off Cambric Creek’s bustling Main Street. She wanted to settle into the shadows and get lost there, and if she had to talk to anyone, it would be to herself. She didn’t expect the shadows to talk back. The shadowy proprietor of the Azathé Tea Room isn’t content to watch Harper sink into depression day after day within the walls of their establishment. Once they intervene, Harper is drawn into their world of oddity and emotions, where the darkest shadows can reside in the light, and even the most mildly macabre witch can find her place. Two For Tea is a human/monster romance featuring a bi demisexual F witch and a non-binary (and very non-human) shadow creature. It is set in the world of Cambric Creek, but can be enjoyed as a standalone, but will best be appreciated read as part of the series. Themes included: ALL the creepy/cozy aesthetic, acceptance of grief, working through depression, why choose appendages, finding one's place.

Although her medical skills are enough to keep them alive, it’s a constant battle for survival—until a huge scarred Cire warrior comes to their rescue.  Captain Thraxar doesn’t get involved.
