And it won’t be with senior citizen discounts. With Ryker unconscious in the hospital, fighting for his life, the investigation drags Piper, Gran, and their trouble-magnet neighbor Edie into the seedy underbelly of Bitter End, where infiltrating dive bars becomes part of the job, gang members have the collective IQ of a houseplant, and everyone’s got something to hide.

A high-stakes cold case that could overturn a decade-old conviction.  A man has spent years behind bars for a brutal crime—but did he do it?

Over 2000 pages of crime-solving. Beneath the charm of the village Tarnfield lies a trail of murder, lies — and one unlikely sleuth. Meet the Amateur Sleuth Suzy Spencer never planned on village life — or amateur sleuthing. A former London TV producer turned single mum, she moved to Tarnfield when her husband Nigel uprooted the family for his advertising job. He lasted a year before running off with his new PA, leaving Suzy behind with the kids, a mortgage, and no plan B.  Now Suzy’s juggling freelance media work, chaotic school runs, and a church flower rota she never actually signed up for. Sharp, irreverent, and usually running late, she’s more at home with takeaway pizza than floral swags — but she has a knack for spotting what others miss.  Messy but intuitive, underestimated but relentless — Suzy may not look the part, but she’s exactly the woman to unravel the secrets simmering beneath Tarnfield’s picturesque surface. And when secrets start bubbling to the surface in Tarnfield, she can’t help digging — especially with quiet, grief-stricken Robert Clark often by her side. The Setting Tarnfield looks like a postcard-perfect Cumbrian village — rugged fells, stone cottages, winding lanes. But beneath the charm lies a hotbed of secrets and simmering tensions. Life revolves around All Saints Church, where parishioners are as quick to gossip as they are to pray. There’s the Lo-cost supermarket, the Plough pub, and a constant hum of village drama. The pavements are uneven, the flower arranging fiercely competitive, and outsiders like Suzy Spencer soon learn that even the prettiest places can hide dark truths. Behind the Easter services and choir rehearsals lurk rivalries, scandals — and the occasional murder. Fans of LJ Ross, Rhys Bowen, Richard Osman, Jeanne M. Dams, Frances Evesham and Margaret Mayhew are sure to be enchanted. PRAISE FOR THE TARNFIELD COZY MYSTERIES: 'A pleasure to read . . . engrossing to the end.'

I couldn’t stop reading it—” – Bestselling author Freida McFadden  Two million dollars each. It seems too good to be true. For Meri Wetzel, it's an offer she can't resist. After her disastrous experience on the TV show A Little Slice of Haven, she's spent the last two decades avoiding her co-star, Jeff. And she's not the only one with bad memories of the show. But when billionaire Felix Worthington invites the five cast members to recreate their roles twenty-five years later, she’s intrigued but skeptical. It’s an unusual request, even for a self-professed superfan like Felix. Living in a recreated version of the 1940s town in a warehouse in Montana has its appeal, even knowing they’ll be filmed with hidden cameras as they improvise with other actors playing the townspeople. And the clincher? The promised two million dollars, on the condition they stay ten days and remain in character the entire time. One by one, the cast sets aside their hesitations and agrees to the terms. But as they delve deeper into their roles, tensions rise, and secrets are revealed. Will they be able to keep up the act and earn their two million dollars? Or will the consequences of their past come back to haunt them? Fans of suspenseful, character-driven dramas will love this story of fame, money, and the price of playing pretend.

In Brambleberry Bay, pumpkin spice comes with a body count. Fall’s favorite flavor just turned fatal, and this Thanksgiving, secrets are the main ingredient. It’s autumn in Brambleberry Bay and the leaves are falling and the air is crisp. The whole town is gearing up for our annual Pumpkin Spice Festival with festive treats, cozy sweaters, rides, games, and a touch of small-town charm. It’s the perfect time to relax, and snuggle with my boyfriend and talking pets—until someone drops dead at my feet. I just can’t catch a break.  It’s so cozy it’s criminal! *RECIPE INCLUDED*  There’s nothing like a cozy fall festival, crisp autumn air, and a steaming cup of pumpkin spice latte—unless you’re sipping it while someone drops dead in the middle of the Pumpkin Palooza.  Hi, I’m Hattie Holiday. Mind reader, animal whisperer, and unofficial ringleader of Brambleberry Bay’s most eccentric murder club. When the beloved owner of Spice It Up Café keels over just before being crowned Pumpkin Queen, I smell something foul—and it’s not just the cinnamon overload in her award-winning pie.  Was it the bitter baker she beat out for the crown? The café rival whose recipe she may have stolen? Or the shady head judge with a messy past and a suspiciously close connection to the victim?  Between decoding deadly desserts and trying to figure out if my hot detective boyfriend is secretly rekindling things with his ex, it’s a miracle I haven’t been poisoned by pumpkin myself. But with my wily crew and furry sidekicks by my side, we’ll sift through suspects faster than you can say “maple-glazed murder.”  One thing is for sure—this fall, someone is baking up more than just trouble. And I intend to serve justice with a side of whipped cream.  A mind reader. Talking pets. An arrogant homicide detective. A murder club. And a corpse.  Welcome to the club. Getting in was easy. Getting out can be murder.  Living in Brambleberry Bay can be a real killer.  It’s criminally cozy.

Superintendent Richard Jury is called in to investigate, and quickly realizes that everyone in Treadnor’s life – from his widow, Alice, to the staff at his manor, to his business partner had differing opinions of him. And to complicate things further, Jury has just happened upon a photo in a newspaper of a man in the United States, who is a dead ringer for Treadnor.  Meanwhile, Wiggins, Jury’s partner at New Scotland Yard, becomes sidetracked by an investigation of his own: His sister, missing for years and presumed dead, has just sent a postcard to their mother. When Wiggins takes off in search of his sister, the two investigations begin to converge.

He is dead people. And their canine companion has a few secrets of her own. Together, they're Lockwood Cove's most dysfunctional detective trio!  When aspiring romance novelist Anna McGuffin relocates to Lockwood Cove, she’s hoping for a quiet retreat to jumpstart her writing—not a haunted mansion complete with a grumpy ghost and a mischievous stray dachshund.  Anna's lifelong secret? She can see the dead—a fact she's managed to keep hidden from the world. But she’s never encountered a ghost quite like Richard Lockwood—a 19th-century detective with the brooding good looks straight out of one of Anna’s novels. Unfortunately, he also has a chip on his shoulder and is hellbent on driving her out of his home.  Between Richard’s sharp-tongued sarcasm and stubborn refusal to ‘move on,’ he quickly becomes more than just a ghostly annoyance—especially when he starts rewriting Anna’s manuscripts and short-circuiting her electronics. Good thing Anna’s not easily spooked. It’ll take more than a moody, meddling spirit to send her packing.  But when Tracy Grace, a nosy ghosthunter seeking a sensational story about Anna, turns up dead, Anna becomes the prime suspect. Desperate to clear her name and keep her closely guarded secret safe, Anna strikes a deal with Richard: help her solve the murder, and she’ll leave his beloved mansion for good—a pact he gleefully accepts.  Now, this odd couple must work together to catch a killer.

It’s down to Losers Club, a quirky weight loss group led by the intrepid Penny Moon, to catch the culprit.  With a recommendation from Mumsnet as a must-read Summer book of 2022 and 1000s of five-star Amazon reviews, this popular, light-hearted murder mystery is the first instalment in a continually expanding series.  When Old Archie the postman is shot and ends up in Mrs Hubbard's ice cream freezer, the whole island is aghast. Especially Mr Hubbard, who objects strongly to having to move all the ice lollies into the other freezer.  Newly divorced and desperate to make a life for herself and her teenage children, Penny Moon arrives on Vik just in the nick of time, before the island is cut off by a storm.  Her weight loss business doesn't have the best of starts, when a series of blunders leads to it being called Losers Club. However, it does have the best of people - a decent, disparate bunch who decide that, with the police unlikely to arrive any time soon and a murderer on the loose, it is down to Losers Club to investigate.  As they dig deeper into the mystery, they uncover a dark secret, kept by the older islanders for almost half a century. A secret that has come back to haunt them and threatens their very existence.  ‘Just the right balance of humour and mystery, I was kept in suspense all the way through.

Always impeccably polite — he knows how to navigate aristocratic pretensions, local feuds, and the labyrinthine ties of old village families, all without ruffling too many feathers. French is the kind of man who drinks strong tea, keeps a dog-eared notebook, and believes very firmly that murder, no matter how genteel its setting, must be treated with absolute seriousness. Thirty-something Sergeant Glyn Edwards is weathered from years of police work, with a dry humour that’s a hit among Oldminster’s tight-lipped locals. He lives with his wife Sandra, but his home life is anything but blissful. With his marriage slowly derailing, all he has to fall back on is his work. Edwards isn’t one for grand theories, but he sees the small things: the nervy glance, the missing key, the crack in a polished alibi. He’s the one who usually notices something that turns the whole case on its head. Together, French and Edwards unravel the most tangled of crimes proving that murder cannot hide . . . even in the prettiest villages.
