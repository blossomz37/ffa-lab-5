No big deal.  I've been keeping this secret for four years, counting down the months in between visits from Onyx.  To everyone else I'm “Hero” but he mostly just calls me “yes” and “more” while we trade heated kisses and wandering hands.  I know it won't ever be anything more than a wild secret and eventually he'll get bored hooking up with a tattoo artist fifteen years too old for him from Nowhere, Wisconsin. But I'm more than happy to enjoy this while it lasts.  But when Onyx shows up unannounced and tells me that instead of a hurried weekend we have 3 full months before he has to hit the road again, I don't know if I'm more excited or terrified to see where things will go.  I’m sure there’s more to life than tattooing Onyx and spending late nights talking until the sun comes up, but whatever that “more” is, it can’t be as fun as this.

Except Adler comes back… And I’m tasked with training him to be a ranch hand. No matter how tempting Adler’s easy smiles are, I can’t risk a repeat encounter for several reasons: I’m his boss. I hate gossip, especially when I’m the subject. And doing my job right will always be my top priority. Adler challenges all of that with chaos, rescue dogs, and an attraction that refuses to quit. As the weeks pass, our connection deepens into a secret fling. My rodeo days taught me how to handle a rough ride, but Adler has me falling fast. Landing in the dirt is going to hurt, but I can’t bring myself to end things. Adler’s everything I never knew I wanted, but he won’t be content with staying in the shadows forever. Can I be the cowboy he needs and deserves before he’s gone for good? Keep You Safe is book two in beloved author Annabeth Albert’s small-town Colorado cowboy romance series with Yellowstone meets Schitt’s Creek vibes.

Cole “Trick” Harrington III has made a career out of pretending he doesn’t care. Not about his past, his name, or the father who built a megachurch empire off judgment and control. Trick torched every bridge back to Atlanta, deliberately wrecked his career, and buried his truth so deep even he started to forget it. Now traded to the Harrisburg Railers, he's skating on thin ice, with a reputation for arrogance and a career teetering on the edge. The last thing he needs is a PR stunt tying him to a squeaky-clean football star, particularly one who is sexy, strong, and always freaking happy. As Trick is forced to confront his growing attraction and deal with the past he’s spent years ignoring—including the younger sister he never knew existed—he realizes that the most brutal battles aren’t fought on the ice. They’re fought in the heart. And this time, he has to stop running.  Tom Fulkowski has led a charmed life. Starting with a typical middle-class childhood in Philly, his skill at catching quarterbacks has propelled him to the heights of pro football. He’s got the rings, he’s got the cash, and he’s got the cars. He’s also got a bad back, achy knees, and a yearning to move on. With one final season to play with the Philadelphia Pumas before retirement, Tom looks forward to that next phase of his life. He’s just not sure what the next phase is exactly. Then, out of the blue, he meets a wild-eyed hockey player with a chip the size of the Liberty Bell on his shoulder. As he and Cole grow closer, he finds a depth to the younger man that resonates deeply. If only Cole would slow down and let Tom catch up to him, they might win it all.

The thought of confessing my feelings and possibly losing him is so gut-wrenching that I’ve hidden my true identity from everyone, including myself. Until now. While staying with my grandparents for spring break—away from the testosterone-filled house I share with Shane and two other roommates—I decide I’m finally ready to pursue my attraction to guys. When I get back to campus, I download a gay dating app to meet people.

What’s better than attending your ex’s wedding? A camping trip in the woods, complete with bugs, critters, and sharing a tent with the hottest—and most infuriating—man alive. It’s basically a full itinerary of terrible decisions…  George: When I came home for the first time in years, I was expecting a peaceful week celebrating my ex’s upcoming nuptials, some quality time with my overly enthusiastic mom, and a much-needed break from the dumpster fire that my life has become. Instead, I’ve been tricked into sharing a tent with Alex—the human equivalent of a smug smirk—who somehow manages to be both infuriating and alarmingly attractive. He pushes every button I have, knows exactly how to get under my skin, and worst of all… I think I want him to. Which is great, because nothing says “relaxing vacation” like emotional whiplash and unresolved sexual tension in a nylon sweatbox. Alex: I keep things casual. It’s easier that way. Safer than letting someone in and finding out—once again—that I’m not enough, or worse, that I’m too much. But George? He’s messing with my game plan. He’s uptight, prickly, and has made it painfully clear that he doesn’t like me. But there’s something in the way his eyes spark when we argue, something in his laugh and those quiet moments when we’re not at each other’s throats, that draws me in. The more time we spend together, the harder it is to ignore the pull between us. It terrifies me—because I want him, badly —but I can’t let him see the mess I’ve been hiding behind these walls. Not now. Not ever.  Cloudy With a Chance of Bad Decisions is a standalone MM romance with high heat, a HEA, and no cliffhangers.

When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal.

Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all?

There’s always a price to pay—a price you won’t discover until your request has been granted. It was a path I swore I’d never walk. Or so I thought.  When my brother is gravely injured, everything changes. I have no choice but to go to The Firm. I don’t know what they’ll ask of me, but I’ll give anything to save Jackson. He has his whole life ahead of him, and I’ll make sure he gets to live it.  But when my price comes due, it’s nothing like I expected. Not drug smuggling or murder. Not the darkness I braced myself for. No, this is worse.  My price is to fulfill someone else’s request. To give them what they asked for.  A marriage.  For anyone else, it may seem simple. But not for me. Because the man I must marry is my worst enemy. My rival. The man I once trusted above all others—until he shattered that trust and threw it back in my face.  The idea of pretending to be Matthias’s doting husband for a year is my worst nightmare. But I won’t do it for me. I’ll do it for Jackson. For my brother, I’ll pay the price.

Miguel Ramirez was living his happily ever after with husbands Quentin and Elliott when tragedy struck.

After months of desperate searching, Miguel gets a tip about Elliott’s whereabouts—one that leads him straight into the heart of Alaska’s most brutal snowstorm on record.

As buried secrets rise to the surface, missing puzzle pieces begin shifting into place, and Miguel comes to realize he never truly knew his husband at all.

Big deal if he also happens to be my best friend’s boss.  Ford Wesley, Captain of the Wolf Creek Fire Department, is the whole package, with hair that’s a delicious mix of dark and silver strands, and deep brown eyes that hold a touch of mystery.  He’s also always been off the market… Until now.  When he gets caught in a bind and has to temporarily stay on my family’s property, I know it’s my chance to get closer to him, but I never expected it to be so easy.  One night, I match with an anonymous stranger on an app, and it doesn’t take long for things to go from innocent and flirty to raunchy and scorching.  Then when I catch a glimpse of my new neighbor shirtless one day, it becomes clear Mr. Tall, Broody, and Off Limits is the mystery man sending filthy messages to me every night online.  The best part? His profile may be anonymous, but mine isn’t… He knows exactly who he’s talking to.  The chemistry on the app morphs into a reality in the sheets…and at the firehouse, and what starts out as a secret, no-strings arrangement quickly becomes so much more. Before I know it, it’s not just his body I crave, but everything he keeps close to his heart as well.  But I’m not the settle down type, and he’s fresh out of a long marriage.

Roman Pain is the only thing that makes me feel alive anymore. On the ice, in the gym, or from someone else’s fists—it doesn’t matter, as long as it drowns out the void inside me. Caleb was my first love, my best-kept secret, and the reason my world fell apart. I thought the guilt would destroy me, but then his brother, Damon, walked back into my life. Damon is all sharp edges and raw anger, and I should stay the hell away from him. But his rage cuts in a way that feels too much like salvation. I hate how much I need it. Damon Roman Bishop was the golden boy who could do no wrong in my little brother’s eyes. But I see the truth—he’s the one who broke Caleb, who drove him to a choice he never should’ve made. Now, Roman’s the one who needs breaking. I came back to Blackthorne to make him pay, to ruin him the way he ruined my brother. But every time I push, he leans in, like he’s begging for more.

On the field, in my reputation, and in keeping my demons buried where no one can see. Sage Blackwell was never supposed to be a part of that. The nerdy prodigy overheard something that could ruin my entire career, so I do the only logical thing. I don’t threaten him. I don’t scare him off. I claim him. I tell myself it’s about survival, about keeping my secret safe. But the longer I keep him close, the more I realize I might be addicted again. Only this time, my drug of choice is him. Sage I wasn’t supposed to hear it. I definitely wasn’t supposed to get caught. One wrong step. One overheard conversation. That’s all it takes to make me the unwilling keeper of Luca Devereaux’s darkest secret. Now, Blackthorne U’s arrogant, untouchable quarterback, has decided I belong to him. He’s relentless, possessive and cruel in the way only someone with too much power and too little consequences can be. Being owned by Luca might just destroy me… especially when I realize I don’t want him to let go. *** Bitter When He Begs is the second book in the interconnected Sinners of Blackthorne U series, but it is a complete standalone.
