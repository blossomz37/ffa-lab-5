Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. In the nonmagic human world--the world of ""Muggles""--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley.  A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: ""We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."" Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, ""I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!"" Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, first published in England as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, continues to win major awards in England. So far it has won the National Book Award, the Smarties Prize, the Children's Book Award, and is short-listed for the Carnegie Medal, the U.K. version of the Newbery Medal. This magical, gripping, brilliant book--a future classic to be sure--will leave kids clamoring for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

On the night Rune’s life changed forever, blood ran in the streets. Now, in the aftermath of a devastating revolution, witches have been diminished from powerful rulers to outcasts ruthlessly hunted due to their waning magic, and Rune must hide what she is. Spending her days pretending to be nothing more than a vapid young socialite, Rune spends her nights as the Crimson Moth, a witch vigilante who rescues her kind from being purged. When a rescue goes wrong, she decides to throw the witch hunters off her scent and gain the intel she desperately needs by courting the handsome Gideon Sharpe - a notorious and unforgiving witch hunter loyal to the revolution - who she can't help but find herself falling for. Gideon loathes the decadence and superficiality Rune represents, but when he learns the Crimson Moth has been using Rune’s merchant ships to smuggle renegade witches out of the republic, he inserts himself into her social circles by pretending to court her right back. He soon realizes that beneath her beauty and shallow façade, is someone fiercely intelligent and tender who feels like his perfect match. Except, what if she’s the very villain he’s been hunting? Kristen Ciccarelli’s Heartless Hunter is the thrilling start to The Crimson Moth duology, a romantic fantasy series where the only thing more treacherous than being a witch...is falling in love. “Enchanting and deeply romantic, Heartless Hunter drew me in with the first sentence and left me breathless by the last.

I was enthralled from the first page."" - Isabel Ibañez, #1 New York Times bestselling author A WITCH... Rune Winters is on the run. Ever since the boy she loved, Gideon Sharpe, revealed who she was and delivered her into enemy hands, everyone wants her dead. If Rune hopes to survive, she must ally herself with the cruel and dangerous Cressida Roseblood, who’s planning to take back the Republic and reinstate a Reign of Witches—something Cressida needs Rune to accomplish. A WITCH HUNTER... Apparently it wasn’t enough for Rune to deceive Gideon; she’s now betrayed him by joining forces with the witch who made his life a living hell. Gideon won’t allow the Republic to fall to the witches and be plunged back into the nightmares of the past. In order to protect this new world he fought for, every last witch must die—especially Rune Winters. AN IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE... When Rune makes Gideon an offer he can’t refuse, the two must pair up to accomplish dangerous goals. The more they’re forced into each other’s company, the more Gideon realizes the feelings he had for Rune aren’t as dead and buried as he thought. Now he’s faced with a terrible choice: sacrifice the girl he loves to stop a monster taking back power, or let Rune live and watch the world he fought so hard for burn.

And when the king decreed that all Ordinaries be banished to preserve his Elite society, lacking an ability suddenly became a crime—making Paedyn Gray a felon by fate and a thief by necessity. Surviving in the slums as an Ordinary is no simple task, and Paedyn knows this better than most. Having been trained by her father to be keenly observant since she was a child, Paedyn poses as a Psychic in the crowded city, blending in with the Elites as best she can to stay alive and out of trouble…easier said than done. When Paeydn unsuspectingly saves one of Ilya’s princes, she finds herself thrown into the Purging Trials. The brutal competition exists to showcase the Elites’ powers—the very thing Paedyn lacks. If the Trials and the opponents within them don’t kill her, the prince she’s fighting feelings for certainly will if he discovers what she is…completely Ordinary.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PxySZmi-L._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C541SB5M,"[""Psychic"",""Crime"",""Fantasy"",""Pandemic""]","[""[#2 in Teen & Young Adult Fiction about Class Differences](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/15249087011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#3 in Teen & Young Adult Fantasy Romance](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/10368618011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#4 in Teen & Young Adult Dark Fantasy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/13922497011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)""]",New York Times bestseller Elites’ powers their kingdom’s grueling laws young adult fantasy his whole life hunting heart-pounding series Only the extraordinary belong,Third,true,false,true

Roman is missing, and the city of Oath continues to dwell in a state of disbelief and ignorance. When Iris and Attie are given another chance to report on Dacre’s movements, they both take the opportunity and head westward once more despite the danger, knowing it’s only a matter of time before the conflict reaches a city that’s unprepared and fracturing beneath the chancellor’s reign. Since waking below in Dacre’s realm, Roman cannot remember his past. But given the reassurance that his memories will return in time, Roman begins to write articles for Dacre, uncertain of his place in the greater scheme of the war. When a strange letter arrives by wardrobe door, Roman is first suspicious, then intrigued. As he strikes up a correspondence with his mysterious pen pal, Roman will soon have to make a decision: to stand with Dacre or betray the god who healed him. And as the days grow darker, inevitably drawing Roman and Iris closer together…the two of them will risk their very hearts and futures to change the tides of the war.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LPgit3OhL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4JKK6QN,"[""Mystery""]","[""[#1 in Teen & Young Adult Magical Realism Fiction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/13922489011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#2 in Teen & Young Adult Magical Realism eBooks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/15249170011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#7 in Teen & Young Adult Sword & Sorcery Fantasy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/10368635011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)""]",chancellor’s reign intensely romantic and beautifully written story his mysterious pen pal,Third,false,false,true

Not when I was five and told them about the boy with pointy ears who saved my life in the forest. Not during thirteen miserable years of bullying and being labeled the town weirdo.  Until a guy with golden eyes and a royal guard escort shows up at my door to drop a bombshell.  That little boy? Yeah, he’s real.  And he’s a fae Prince.  And he magically linked my life to his when he saved me.  I know what you’re thinking. Lucky girl, right?  Wrong.  Because now the Prince is sick and apparently, I’m the only one who can save him. How can I possibly say no?  That’s how I find myself in the fae realm, where pretty much everything either wants to kill me, eat me, or... use me for something worse. If not for the gorgeous fae who saved my life, I'd have died an hour in.  Mr. Tall-Dark-and-Grumpy has annoyingly beautiful eyes, a voice that sounds like sex, and a tattoo that screams trouble. He says his name is Rune, and he’ll take me to the Prince safely—if I do what he says.  Unfortunately for me, he looks like he's made of shadows and really bad decisions, so naturally, I follow him.  But the more time we spend together, the more near-death experiences we go through, the more Rune gets under my skin. He makes most people look the other way, but he's sweet when no one's watching. He makes my heart do really weird things.  And just when I think my life couldn’t possibly get any crazier—it does.  Turns out, this whole saving-the-Prince business can get a girl into a whole lot of trouble, and I’m not entirely sure I can handle it this time. ** Lifebound is a romantasy with a delicious shadow fae and a couple of very spicy scenes. You can expect tropes like: she falls first--he falls harder, touch her & die, one *horse* trope, fae royalty, fated…but not *mates,* Prince Charming included (just not in your usual kind of way).

Kim Liggett's The Grace Year is a speculative thriller in the vein of The Handmaid’s Tale and The Power. Survive the year. No one speaks of the grace year. It’s forbidden. In Garner County, girls are told they have the power to lure grown men from their beds, to drive women mad with jealousy. They believe their very skin emits a powerful aphrodisiac, the potent essence of youth, of a girl on the edge of womanhood. That’s why they’re banished for their sixteenth year, to release their magic into the wild so they can return purified and ready for marriage. But not all of them will make it home alive. Sixteen-year-old Tierney James dreams of a better life—a society that doesn’t pit friend against friend or woman against woman, but as her own grace year draws near, she quickly realizes that it’s not just the brutal elements they must fear. It’s not even the poachers in the woods, men who are waiting for a chance to grab one of the girls in order to make a fortune on the black market. Their greatest threat may very well be each other. With sharp prose and gritty realism, The Grace Year examines the complex and sometimes twisted relationships between girls, the women they eventually become, and the difficult decisions they make in-between. “A visceral, darkly haunting fever dream of a novel and an absolute page-turner.” – Libba Bray, New York Times bestselling author",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41AdHdQZ1dL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MBY35R9,"[""Thriller"",""Magic""]","[""[#5 in Teen & Young Adult Fiction on Girls' & Women's Issues (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/15249110011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#6 in Teen & Young Adult Dystopian eBooks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/7006666011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#7 in Teen & Young Adult Thrillers & Suspense (Kindle Store)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/11650875011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)""]",just the brutal elements her own grace year Handmaid’s Tale Instant New York Times Bestseller Kim Liggett's The Grace Year complex and sometimes twisted relationships,Third,true,false,true

Should she stay mortal and strengthen her connection to the werewolves—or leave it all behind to become a vampire? When you loved the one who was killing you, it left you no options. How could you run, how could you fight, when doing so would hurt that beloved one? If your life was all you had to give, how could you not give it? If it was someone you truly loved? To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife have led her to the ultimate turning point.

A New Body. A Second Chance to Fight—for Life, for Family, and for Power. Nate didn't want to die. But after years of battling a sickness that had left him a mere shell of what he once was, he wasn’t exactly clinging to life either. Then everything changed. His final breath was just a new beginning, one that led to him waking up in a world almost identical to his own. He has the same parents, same name, even the same face in the mirror. But this Earth is different. Stranger. Better in some ways, and so much more dangerous in others. Here, monsters roam the cities’ edges, newly developed cultivation arts shape reality, and dimensional zones pulse throughout the surface of the world like living hearts. Not everything is perfect. There is a reason he was able to cross over into that body. Troubles that might be solved with the help of… Whatever force pulled Nate across worlds didn’t send him empty-handed. Buried deep inside him is a gift—something powerful, mysterious… something extra. A spark of creation, a source of endless potential. If Nate can learn to master it, he might not just survive—he could thrive. However, as he will soon discover, power attracts danger, and in this world, monsters aren't the only things that hunt. To protect the people he loves, Nate will have to grow stronger, faster, smarter. Because second chances don’t come free—and this time, he's willing to fight for every breath.

Set on a modern, alternative Earth that has been besieged by dimensional zones through which monsters and beasts have been invading the planet for years. This series is a perfect fit for readers who enjoy smart, emotionally complex characters inside an ever-evolving universe, with a protagonist that is simply glad to have his parents back, while also struggling to find his own place in this new world. What RoyalRoad readers are saying: ★★★★★ Dungeonfall - Cool Party - Lovely dungeon story so far. Cultivation seems to work differently in the story, with the MC taking damage yet getting benefits that help him out later on. I especially like his parents still being alive, as killing off authority figures tends to happen way too often in this type of story. Overall, a lighthearted, clever story. - snowbell ★★★★★ Fantastic take on dungeon/cultivation story - I must say I have been enjoying dungeon building stories but a lot of the time they run into the same issues, stuck in one spot (forced alternate POV’s), and either murderous for the sake of being murderous or ultra nice for the sake of it being younger audience friendly. This takes a step out in a new direction and really allows more depth to the concept. Interesting take on cultivation, overall, I have really enjoyed it and am looking forward to more. - blackius420 ★★★★★ Great World - So this is a second read-through as I wait for new chapters. This is a very different world and a unique take on the dungeon core and cultivating genres. I love how the two were combined and so give us something completely unexpected. I would suggest not thinking of it as a dungeon story, nor of it as cultivating. Just think of it as the personal journal in an adventure story with some dungeon and cultivating aspects. - Morebooks ★★★★★ An Underdog's Tale - This piece was a pleasure to read, and I highly recommend it! - tobascoasako ★★★★★ I'm enjoying this so far! - This is a great start for a series. The characters are well defined. The plot so far is interesting and is getting more intriguing all the time. I look forward to seeing where the author takes this story. The story has some interesting twists on dungeon creation and game mechanics. - Sarahm",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41J1dOlKXsL._SY445_SX342_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9CP5QGR,"[""Crime"",""Fantasy"",""Monsters"",""Aristocracy"",""Second Chance"",""Mystery"",""LitRPG"",""Biker""]","[""[#1 in Teen & Young Adult Steampunk](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/7538400011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books)\n[#11 in Teen & Young Adult Science Fiction eBooks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/6110891011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)\n[#46 in GameLit & LitRPG Fiction eBooks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/99546054011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text)""]","smart, emotionally complex characters MC taking damage ever-evolving universe even the same face Underdog's Tale cities’ edges just a new beginning second read-through dungeon/cultivation story Overall, a lighthearted, clever story very different world Dungeon-Core Creation newly developed cultivation arts shape reality Dungeonfall - Cool Party - Lovely dungeon story modern, alternative Earth dungeon creation and game mechanics murderous or ultra nice",Third,true,true,true

As certain death races toward Lightlark and secrets from the past begin to unravel, Isla must weigh her responsibility to her people against the whims of the most dangerous traitor of all: her heart.
