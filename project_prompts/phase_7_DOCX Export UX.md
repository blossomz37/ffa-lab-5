# DOCX Export UX
## Prompt:
```
Implement selection + export:
- Add a checkbox column in DataTable.
- Add "Export to Word (.docx)" button; when clicked, collects selected rows and POSTs to /export/docx
- While generating, show a progress toast; then auto‑download the .docx file.
- Document structure: Title → Author → Rating/Reviews → Ranks → Genre/Date → Product URL; include small cover image left‑aligned.
```
